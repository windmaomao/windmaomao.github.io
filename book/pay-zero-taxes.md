## Exclusions
Tax-Free Money

The most important thing that you as a taxpayer can do to reduce your taxes to zero is to convert fully taxable income into excludable income. An exclusion is something that is not included in gross income. It is the best kind of revenue to receive. If you are in the 25 percent tax bracket (single, taxable income over $37,950), each dollar you convert to excludable income is the equivalent of getting a raise of 25 percent! Therefore, in negotiating compensation, you as an employee-taxpayer should ==examine the following forms of nontaxable remuneration for services rendered as **alternatives to fully taxable cash income**==.

## Credits
Dollar-for-Dollar Tax Reductions

### 59 Saver's Credit

In order to stimulate savings, Congress gives you a credit of up to 50 percent on the first $2,000 you sock away in a traditional or Roth IRA or 401(k). So if you contribute $2,000, you’ll get a $1,000 credit. That’s in addition to the minimum $200 that the $2,000 deduction will save you in taxes (at the 10 percent bracket).

Unfortunately, to get the 50 percent credit, **your adjusted gross income can’t be more than $18,500**. If you then subtract a $4,050 personal exemption and a $6,300 standard deduction, your taxable income is capped at $8,150. The maximum tax on that is $815, not the $1,000 promised by Congress.


### 66 First-Time Home Buyer Credit

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 gave first-time home buyers a refundable tax credit of 10 percent of the purchase price, up to $7,500 ($3,750 for married people filing separately). The credit began to **phase out at the $150,000 adjusted gross income level for joint filers** ($75,000 for other filers) and was not available for joint filers with income above $170,000 ($95,000 for other filers). It also was not available to nonresident aliens, those who qualified for a similar District of Columbia credit, or those whose financing came from tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. The credit was effective for homes purchased on or after April 9, 2008, and before July 1, 2009. But this credit must be paid back, in equal installments for 15 years. So if you got the full $7,500, you’d pay an additional “tax” of $500 each year. Payments start 2 years after the year in which the residence is purchased or earlier, if you sell the house or if it is no longer your principal residence. You qualify as a “first-time home buyer” if neither you nor your spouse had any ownership interest in a principal residence during the 3-year period before the new home is purchased. The best news: is that if you die, you don’t have to pay back the credit.

### 67 "Making Work Pay" Tax Credit

This provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 cut taxes for more than 95 percent of working families in the United States. For 2009 and 2010, the provision provided a refundable tax credit of up to $400 for working individuals and $800 for working families. This refundable tax credit was calculated at a rate of 6.2 percent of earned income, and **phased out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income in excess of $75,000** (==$150,000 for married couples filing jointly==). You could receive this benefit through a reduction in the amount of income tax that was withheld from your paycheck, or through claiming the credit on your tax return using Schedule M.
