## Exclusions
Tax-Free Money

The most important thing that you as a taxpayer can do to reduce your taxes to zero is to convert fully taxable income into excludable income. An exclusion is something that is not included in gross income. It is the best kind of revenue to receive. If you are in the 25 percent tax bracket (single, taxable income over $37,950), each dollar you convert to excludable income is the equivalent of getting a raise of 25 percent! Therefore, in negotiating compensation, you as an employee-taxpayer should ==examine the following forms of nontaxable remuneration for services rendered as **alternatives to fully taxable cash income**==.

### 7 "Expenses of Your Employer"

The law does not tax reimbursement expenses that are true reimbursements for expenses of your employer rather than income amounts truly compensatory in nature.

Under this category are such items as reimbursements for cab fares and the payment of supper money. Rather than being excludable on the basis of statutory or constitutional language, these items are truly nontaxable as the result of Internal Revenue Service recognition of the impossible administrative verification problems in auditing such expenses. For whatever reasons, therefore, they are nontaxable.



### 13 Employer Educational Assistance

This provision excludes from an employee’s gross income employer-provided educational assistance, regardless of whether or not the education is job-related. The provision did not apply to any payment for graduate-level courses (except for those taken in 1995 and those beginning prior to July 1, 1996) taken by an individual pursuing a program leading to an advanced academic or professional degree and is generally not available for any education involving sports, games, or hobbies. Employers are not required to withhold on educational assistance payments, but the exclusion is limited to $5,250 per individual per calendar year. Educational expenses that would be deductible by an employee as trade or business expenses if they had been paid by the employee are not subject to this $5,250 cap.

The 2001 Tax Relief Act made this exclusion permanent and it was extended to cover graduate education as of January 1, 2002. Every employer who maintains an educational assistance program must file a return showing the number of employees eligible to participate in the program; the number participating; the total cost of the program; the employer’s name, address, and taxpayer identification number; and the type of business in which the employer is engaged.

### 14 Employee Awards

*The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed these rules.* That law states specifically that employee awards will *not* be excludable from the employee’s income as gifts. Since such awards will no longer be treated as gifts (and are therefore fully includable as income to the employee), the limitations described on employer deductions for business gifts will no longer apply. The entire amount of the award (assuming ordinary, necessary, and reasonable tests are met) will be deductible.

*Under current law* if the cost to the employer of the qualified plan award exceeds the limits just described, then the employee must include in income the *greater* of (a) the excess of the cost of the award over the amount allowable as a deduction (but not more than the award’s value), or (b) the excess of the value of the award over the amount allowable as a deduction. If the employer’s cost is *not* over the applicable limit, the employee may exclude the award regardless of its value.

After the 1986 law there would no longer be any need to make the subjective determination as to whether the employee award is a gift. No employee awards will be treated as gifts for income tax purposes.

### 21 Interest on State and Municipal Obligations

You can exclude from gross income all interest earned on obligations of a state, territory, municipality, or any political subdivision, except in the case of arbitrage bonds issued after October 9, 1969.

==If you are in a sufficiently high tax bracket, the advantages of purchasing a state or municipal bond can be substantial.== If you are in a 25 percent bracket, a 6½ percent yield on a municipal obligation is the equivalent of a 8.67 percent yield on a nonexempt security. Moreover, the risk factor on a state or municipal obligation will normally be far lower than that on an industrial security. The higher the tax bracket, the greater the attraction of a tax-exempt security.

### 22 Public Assistance Payments

Benefit payments from a general welfare fund in the interest of the general public, such as payments to aid the indigent or the blind, or payments to crime victims, are excludable from your gross income. These welfare payments have been excluded by the Internal Revenue Service, because the IRS sees them in the nature of gifts.

### 23 Social Security and Other Retirement Benefits

Social Security benefits under the federal Social Security programs may not be taxable. Social Security benefits received from foreign countries, however, are taxable unless they are specifically exempt by treaty.

Moreover, basic Medicare benefits received under the Social Security Act are also excluded from gross income since they are considered Social Security payments. So also are supplementary benefits covering costs of doctors’ services and other items not covered under basic Medicare, as they are in the nature of medical insurance payments.

Note, however, that since January 1, 1984, part of your Social Security benefits have been subject to tax if your income exceeded a specified level determined by formula. There are three factors used in determining how much of your Social Security benefits, if any, will be included in taxable income: 

1. Your income, defined as your adjusted gross income for federal income tax plus any tax-exempt interest, plus any foreign source income you receive during the year; 
2. Your half-benefit, defined as half the Social Security income you (and, if you’re married and filing jointly, your spouse) receive during the year; and 
3. Your base amount, which is $25,000 for a single taxpayer, ==$32,000 for a married couple filing jointly==, and zero for a married couple filing separately (unless they have lived apart for the entire tax year, in which case they qualify for the $25,000 base amount).


Effective after December 31, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 created a second tier of Social Security benefit inclusion in gross income. For taxpayers with *income* above these amounts, the amount included in income shall be the *lesser* of:

1. 85 percent of your total Social Security benefit, or
2. the sum of:
  - the smaller of (i) the amount included under prior law; or (ii) $4,500 (if unmarried) or $6,000 (if married filing jointly)
  - 85 percent of the excess of your *income* over the new applicable second tier threshold amounts ($34,000 and **$44,000**).

If your income, modified as above, is over the upper threshold up to 85 percent or your Social Security benefits may be taxed. **Between the base amount and the upper threshold, only 50 percent would be taxed. **



### 25 Sale of Your Home

You may exclude from your gross income some or all of your gain from the sale or exchange of your main home, if you meet certain ownership and use tests at the time of the sale or exchange.

*Prior to May 7, 1997,* you could have expected to exclude from your gross income $125,000 (the maximum allowable) of gain on the sale or exchange of your main home *if:*

- you were age 55 or older before the date of the sale or exchange;
- you owned and lived in the property sold or exchanged as your main home for at least three years out of the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange; *and*
- you or your spouse never excluded gain on the sale or exchange of a home after July 20, 1981.

These rules were *all* changed by the Tax Relief Act of 1997. *After May 6, 1997* joint filers can exclude, as often as every 2 years, as much as $500,000 ($250,000 for single filers) in gain on the sale of a principal residence occupied for 2 of the 5 years prior to sale. To qualify, ==you must have used the house as your principal residence for at least 2 out of the 5 years prior to the sale==. However, the exclusion will be available once every 2 years, although there are exceptions to that rule too. Those close to retirement or whose children have moved out may be big winners here. They can now sell their old, big houses without the need to reinvest in new, more expensive homes to avoid taxation on the gains. They can now buy smaller residences, or even rent. The prior law provision under Section 1034 that deferred taxation upon a rollover of the sales proceeds into a new home has been repealed.

You can get a partial exclusion based on the time of use and ownership, but only if the sale is required because of a *change in place of employment, health reasons, or unforeseen circumstances.* The IRS has been very flexible in defining “unforeseen circumstances.” Even the birth of twins or the hostility of neighbors (PLR 200403049) will now qualify.

Unfortunately, the 1997 law was unclear if you owned the property for less than 2 years. The 1998 Act provided the answer. It provides partial relief based on a fraction of the *maximum exclusion,* rather than on the basis of your actual realized profit.

For example, assume you bought a house in 2016 for $250,000 and sell it in 2017 for a $25,000 profit. Because you are married, and lived there 1 year, you are eligible for half the $500,000 exclusion you would have been entitled to had you been there the full 2 years. Half the exclusion is $250,000, greater than the gain of $25,000, and therefore none of your gain is taxable. Had the alternative interpretation applied, you would have been able to exclude half your profit, and paid tax on the remaining $12,500.

Not everybody wins on this one. Miss Fortune bought her home in 2016 for $1.5 million and sold it 1 year later for a $400,000 profit. Since she is single and lived there only half the required 2 years, she gets to exclude $125,000, and pay tax on $275,000 of her gain. Had the alternative interpretation applied, she would have excluded half her $400,000 gain and only paid taxes on $200,000. Note that any “nonqualifying use,” such as a rental, reduces your exclusion.

There is no age requirement for this exclusion and ==the exclusion can be claimed every 2 years==. However, if you have a $250,000/$500,000 gain every 2 years, I want to meet your real estate broker!

### 26 Carpool Receipts

If you form a carpool to carry passengers to and from work, the amounts received from these passengers are not included in your income. These amounts are considered reimbursement for transportation expenses incurred.

### 28 Damages

Damages received in settlement of a lawsuit or awarded by a court were normally excluded from income under the return of capital doctrine. Theoretically, damages awarded for personal wrong committed against you (for instance, breach of promise to marry, invasion of privacy, libel, slander, alienation of affection) replace the personal capital destroyed by these wrongful acts.[5](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/how-to-pay/9781260115819/ch04.xhtml#ch04fn_5) Defamation awards were also excludable.[6](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/how-to-pay/9781260115819/ch04.xhtml#ch04fn_6) Amounts received as damages for personal injury were excludable under both this doctrine and specific congressional mandate.[7](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/how-to-pay/9781260115819/ch04.xhtml#ch04fn_7) However, damages received as a substitute for income are generally taxable, since they represent a restoration of lost wages or profits that would have been taxable upon receipt.

### 29 Life Insurance

==Life insurance proceeds paid to you because of the death of the insured are not taxable== unless the policy was purchased by you or transferred to you for a price. This is true even if the proceeds are paid under an accident or health insurance policy or an endowment contract.

### 30 Qualified State Tuition (529) Programs

Current law provides tax-exempt status to “Qualified State Tuition Programs.” These are programs established by a state or a state agency under which you can (1) purchase tuition credits or certificates for the payment of education expenses or (2) make contributions into an account established to pay qualified education expenses, such as tuition, books, and fees, and for 2009, 2010, and 2015 forward, computers and computer technology.

The interest or other earnings from such accounts comes out federal and state tax-free! Several states (e.g., New York) have programs where you don’t even have to go to school in that state to qualify. All 50 states have such a program. Following are some of the best. Don’t miss this tax-advantaged way to finance your kid’s college expenses.

Or, you can get really creative. Name yourself as beneficiary of a Section 529 account and save money for a 2- or 3-year sabbatical—tax-free as long as it involves education at an eligible institution! Not only can you use the money for books and tuition, but you can even pay for your apartment up to the amount specified in school guidelines.

As an alternative, check out the *Independent 529 Plan.* It lets you lock in current tuition rates at more than 200 private colleges.

It works like this. Suppose you contribute $10,000. Assume that’s 50 percent of one year’s tuition at school “x.” When you or your child enrolls, you’ve got 50 percent of one year’s tuition paid.

The deals vary per college. But the money invested grows tax free. If you don’t go, you get a refund, plus or minus two percentage points each year, depending on how your investments fared.



### 31 Your Home 

The Mother of All Tax Shelters!

Want to invest in a tax shelter that puts a roof over your head? ==There are more tax advantages and exclusions with respect to your home than any other investment. It’s the American way—Mom, apple pie, and owning your own home.== Let’s look at all the deductions and benefits you get when you pay homage to the mortgage gods and go into more debt than your parents earned in their lifetimes.

## Credits
Dollar-for-Dollar Tax Reductions

### 59 Saver's Credit

In order to stimulate savings, Congress gives you a credit of up to 50 percent on the first $2,000 you sock away in a traditional or Roth IRA or 401(k). So if you contribute $2,000, you’ll get a $1,000 credit. That’s in addition to the minimum $200 that the $2,000 deduction will save you in taxes (at the 10 percent bracket).

Unfortunately, to get the 50 percent credit, **your adjusted gross income can’t be more than $18,500**. If you then subtract a $4,050 personal exemption and a $6,300 standard deduction, your taxable income is capped at $8,150. The maximum tax on that is $815, not the $1,000 promised by Congress.


### 66 First-Time Home Buyer Credit

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 gave first-time home buyers a refundable tax credit of 10 percent of the purchase price, up to $7,500 ($3,750 for married people filing separately). The credit began to **phase out at the $150,000 adjusted gross income level for joint filers** ($75,000 for other filers) and was not available for joint filers with income above $170,000 ($95,000 for other filers). It also was not available to nonresident aliens, those who qualified for a similar District of Columbia credit, or those whose financing came from tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. The credit was effective for homes purchased on or after April 9, 2008, and before July 1, 2009. But this credit must be paid back, in equal installments for 15 years. So if you got the full $7,500, you’d pay an additional “tax” of $500 each year. Payments start 2 years after the year in which the residence is purchased or earlier, if you sell the house or if it is no longer your principal residence. You qualify as a “first-time home buyer” if neither you nor your spouse had any ownership interest in a principal residence during the 3-year period before the new home is purchased. The best news: is that if you die, you don’t have to pay back the credit.

### 67 "Making Work Pay" Tax Credit

This provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 cut taxes for more than 95 percent of working families in the United States. For 2009 and 2010, the provision provided a refundable tax credit of up to $400 for working individuals and $800 for working families. This refundable tax credit was calculated at a rate of 6.2 percent of earned income, and **phased out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income in excess of $75,000** (==$150,000 for married couples filing jointly==). You could receive this benefit through a reduction in the amount of income tax that was withheld from your paycheck, or through claiming the credit on your tax return using Schedule M.
