# Slash Your Retirement Risk

## Why Traditiona lInvestment Strategies No Longer Work

### The Failures of Traditional Investment Strategies

Because we live in volatile times—defined by market extremes and great economic and militaristic upheavals—our investment decisions can end up marked by greed or fear. Investors often **look for home-run returns** or it seems like they’re **stuffing their money under the mattress**. Neither of those approaches will help achieve your retirement goals.

### The Pursuit of Reliable Income: "New ROI"

Today’s investor needs an investment strategy that **captures aggressive equity growth while accounting for extreme market volatility**, economic uncertainty, and geopolitical upheaval, which have become all too common in recent times. Investors also need triggers in place to protect them against bear markets that can wreck retirement dreams.

The New ROI approach to equity investing recognizes all of today’s investing realities and is designed to give your money the opportunity to capitalize on market upsides while minimizing losses on the downside.


### Fallacies, Fantasies, and Biases in Today's Investment World

Successful investing, after all, is not about silver bullets or magic beans. This isn’t about fairy tales. When I talk with clients, we discuss their nest eggs, assets, and retirement dreams. And, we talk about these topics in real terms, using real-life scenarios, data-tested science, and economics, not pie-in-the-sky fantasies.

Think about how you might react if someone offered you the deal-ofa-lifetime with **the promise of riches**. It feels good. You may even decide to go for it. But, by the time your human **survival instinct kicks in and you get the signal to run**, it’s too late. *You’ve already lost your money.*

### Maintain Discipline: Get the Emotion Out and Watch Your Portfolio Grow

That’s why in times of economic and emotional turmoil and stress, the savvy investor doesn’t ask, **“What should I do with my investments now?”** or “Who should I ask for advice?” Instead, he or she already has a portfolio management strategy in place that cuts emotions from the equation.

When it comes to the equity portion of your portfolio, the “New ROI” does just that by laying out in advance a set of strict ground rules based on sound investing fundamentals and science based on decades of proven results. Those rules spell out what moves to make, when to make them, and how those triggers will be pulled. **Nothing is left to chance or whims.** That in turn can eliminate the uncertainty and fear associated with our culture’s day-to-day, week-to-week, and month-to-month political and economic turmoil, and the dramatic market swings that often result.

Many investors may have attributed their escape from losses that night to luck. I prefer to approach investing with sound fundamentals and mechanical models. Because of that philosophy, on election night, as markets yo-yoed from one end of the spectrum to the other, my holdings and those of our clients were secure. **It didn’t matter who won the election; we had the same plan in place regardless of a Trump or Clinton victory.** The real winners that night were our clients whose investments weren’t affected by the recklessness of human emotions.

Anyone—whether an individual investor or professional equities trader—can fall prey to emotion-driven erratic behavior unless he or she has **in place a mechanical model** in their investing. That’s a set of pre-determined rules for investing that are followed no matter what.

Not doing so can lead to disastrous portfolio performance results—in the short term or over the long haul. Whether over a one-year time span or 30 years, without a strict, rules-based portfolio management strategy in place, individuals can’t get the emotion out of their investment decisions, and their investment returns often reflect that inability. **Individuals simply end up making bad investor decisions at critical points**, according to research from Dalbar, investor behavior experts.

Emotion-driven investing isn’t a new phenomenon. Thomas Gibson studied and wrote about it in his 1922 investment classic, The Facts About Speculation. After analyzing 4,000 investment accounts—a large number for his era—Gibson concluded, “The most glaringly apparent cause of loss... was the almost universal habit of **making purchases at high prices after a material rise** had already occurred. This error is of a wholly psychological character.”
