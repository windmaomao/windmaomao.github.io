# Slash Your Retirement Risk

## Part I - Why Traditional Investment Strategies No Longer Work

### The Failures of Traditional Investment Strategies

Because we live in volatile times—defined by market extremes and great economic and militaristic upheavals—our investment decisions can end up marked by greed or fear. Investors often **look for home-run returns** or it seems like they’re **stuffing their money under the mattress**. Neither of those approaches will help achieve your retirement goals.

### The Pursuit of Reliable Income: "New ROI"

Today’s investor needs an investment strategy that **captures aggressive equity growth while accounting for extreme market volatility**, economic uncertainty, and geopolitical upheaval, which have become all too common in recent times. Investors also need triggers in place to protect them against bear markets that can wreck retirement dreams.

The New ROI approach to equity investing recognizes all of today’s investing realities and is designed to give your money the opportunity to capitalize on market upsides while minimizing losses on the downside.


### Fallacies, Fantasies, and Biases in Today's Investment World

Successful investing, after all, is not about silver bullets or magic beans. This isn’t about fairy tales. When I talk with clients, we discuss their nest eggs, assets, and retirement dreams. And, we talk about these topics in real terms, using real-life scenarios, data-tested science, and economics, not pie-in-the-sky fantasies.

> Think about how you might react if someone offered you the deal-ofa-lifetime with **the promise of riches**. It feels good. You may even decide to go for it. But, by the time your human **survival instinct kicks in and you get the signal to run**, it’s too late. *You’ve already lost your money.*

### Maintain Discipline: Get the Emotion Out and Watch Your Portfolio Grow

That’s why in times of economic and emotional turmoil and stress, the savvy investor doesn’t ask, **“What should I do with my investments now?”** or “Who should I ask for advice?” Instead, he or she already has a portfolio management strategy in place that cuts emotions from the equation.

When it comes to the equity portion of your portfolio, the “New ROI” does just that by laying out in advance a set of strict ground rules based on sound investing fundamentals and science based on decades of proven results. Those rules spell out what moves to make, when to make them, and how those triggers will be pulled. **Nothing is left to chance or whims.** That in turn can eliminate the uncertainty and fear associated with our culture’s day-to-day, week-to-week, and month-to-month political and economic turmoil, and the dramatic market swings that often result.

Many investors may have attributed their escape from losses that night to luck. I prefer to approach investing with sound fundamentals and mechanical models. Because of that philosophy, on election night, as markets yo-yoed from one end of the spectrum to the other, my holdings and those of our clients were secure. **It didn’t matter who won the election; we had the same plan in place regardless of a Trump or Clinton victory.** The real winners that night were our clients whose investments weren’t affected by the recklessness of human emotions.

Anyone—whether an individual investor or professional equities trader—can fall prey to emotion-driven erratic behavior unless he or she has **in place a mechanical model** in their investing. That’s a set of pre-determined rules for investing that are followed no matter what.

![Investing and Emotions](https://s3.amazonaws.com/qp-review/slash-retirement-risk-4.1.png)

Not doing so can lead to disastrous portfolio performance results—in the short term or over the long haul. Whether over a one-year time span or 30 years, without a strict, rules-based portfolio management strategy in place, individuals can’t get the emotion out of their investment decisions, and their investment returns often reflect that inability. **Individuals simply end up making bad investor decisions at critical points**, according to research from Dalbar, investor behavior experts.

Emotion-driven investing isn’t a new phenomenon. Thomas Gibson studied and wrote about it in his 1922 investment classic, The Facts About Speculation. After analyzing 4,000 investment accounts—a large number for his era—Gibson concluded, “The most glaringly apparent cause of loss... was the almost universal habit of **making purchases at high prices after a material rise** had already occurred. This error is of a wholly psychological character.”

### Your Portfolio: The Right Mix of Equities and Bonds

When markets fall, bonds typically do very well. At the very least, even if the price to purchase new bonds falls slightly, those already purchased bonds maintain their same income-producing levels. That’s because when you buy a bond, you’re buying its issuer’s obligation to pay a specified amount regularly and to repay the bond’s principal at its maturity. Even if bond prices don’t recover, the bonds still generate the same income stream.

> Instead, the extreme volatility in markets in early 2016 actually pushed bonds higher as investors’ emotions prompted a flight to conservative safe havens. Bonds top that list of safe places.

## Part II - Equities: What to Do Now - THe "New ROI" Strategy

### The Power of Losses

> WHATEVER YOUR RISK tolerance or financial goals, one of the greatest challenges to saving and investing is the **negative power of losses**. A single loss can torpedo a portfolio and, with it, your hopes and dreams of a reliable income and financial security in retirement.

The road to financial recovery is steep, too. If an investment loses half its value, it takes much more than a 50-percent gain to return to initial levels. In fact, a market that’s off 50 percent requires a 100 percent gain to return to break even.

History shows that recovering from these kinds of losses can take years, **years that most investors simply don’t have**. As mentioned above, the S&P 500 climbed back to pre-crash levels by August 2012, but for those investors who lost so much, the power of losses took its toll.

On the other hand, if Peter and Alice had instead embraced the New ROI approach to managing their portfolio, the couple’s capital would have remained intact after the collapse because they would have **deployed a stop-loss when the market dropped 10 percent**. So, rather than losing a big chunk of money, the portfolio would have ended 2008 up slightly—a 1.05-percent gain—and the couple could have retired on time and on track with a $505,237 nest egg.

For Peter and Alice and many others like them, losses take a psychological toll, too. It’s behavioral finance again, and that cognitive bias known as loss aversion that I mentioned earlier.

> In simple terms, we all hate to **lose more than we like to win**, so **losses are twice as powerful as gains psychologically**. If you doubt that, think about professional athletes who often say they like to win, but they *really* hate to lose even more.

![Probability of Recovery](https://s3.amazonaws.com/qp-review/slash-retirement-risk-6.6.png)



- Do you have the patience to wait 10 years or more simply to rebuild a devastated nest egg back to breakeven?
- Do you have the financial wherewithal to live on without having to tap into your nest egg at least until it returns to breakeven? Put plainly, can you afford to allow it to recover?
- What if recovery takes longer than a 10-year projection? Can you afford that?
- Can you forgive yourself?

With all the doom and gloom about the ups and downs of equities markets, by now you’re probably ready to run the other way or even look to your mattress as your money’s best bet. But, as I’ve discussed, in today’s low interest rate environment and with the high cost of living increasing daily, the answer isn’t to run the other direction. **Avoiding equities altogether is a mistake.** A retirement portfolio needs the growth potential that the right equities can offer. But that portfolio also requires that an investor take the right pre-emptive and protective steps now by embracing the New ROI approach to equities management.

### Minimizing Risk and Cutting Your Losses: Your Personal Build-In Stop-Loss Plan

> Don’t expect stop-loss, whether you do it yourself or through an experienced financial advisor, to be a cure-all. In a market freefall, it won’t prevent all portfolio losses. But it will **limit those losses to more manageable numbers so that your money actually has the chance to recover and grow properly within a reasonable time frame.**

#### 10 Percent and Why

![Preservation of Capital](https://s3.amazonaws.com/qp-review/slash-retirement-risk-7.1.png)

If the index is down 10 percent from its high point since you purchased the equities in your portfolio, that’s the signal it’s time get out—to stop the loss and sell all your stock holdings across the various sectors. Take the resulting cash from the sell-off and move it temporarily into a safe haven. If the S&P is off only 9 percent, leave your equity holdings alone, and check back again in a month. If it’s off any more than 10 percent, get out. Sell off the equities.

#### Why Bonds?

All bonds, bond funds, and ETFs are not the same in terms of risk, either. The lower the credit quality of the bonds, the more returns correlate with those of stocks during bear markets. That means if markets are plummeting, so may the stability of a lower-grade bond or bond fund.

A bear market in bonds is much different from a bear market in stocks. A bond market is considered a bear any time bonds lose any value at all, wh-eras the stock market isn’t considered a bear until it’s lost 20 percent of its value. The worst 12-month return in bonds is barely considered a correction in stocks.

> The New ROI stop-loss, as we’ve talked about, is **not meant to suck every penny from the market**. It’s a strategy to help a portfolio grow, while at the same time **protecting it from catastrophic loss**.

#### Timing Your Buyback: The 15-Percent Mark

As an investor, you should continue to check the S&P 500 Index once a month on the last day of the month—or more often if you’re more comfortable doing so. When the S&P has rebounded 15 percent from its bottom—not the point at which you sold off your equities—it’s time to get back into the stock market.

Stop-loss isn’t always a precursor of devastating market declines. Not every 10-percent market drop turns into a bear market or signals a recession ahead. But, an investor—especially with future financial needs in retirement in mind—can’t afford not to pay attention.

> Many of these investors overlook the fact that today’s economic conditions and roller-coaster markets that often test record territory are fraught with downsides, too. Those downs come quickly and can destroy life savings with little hope of full recovery in the limited time frame most soon-to-be retirees have.

Another common mistake investors make with their stop-loss strategy is that, although they may implement it in a timely manner, they jump back into the markets at the slightest uptick and ignore their pre-determined parameters of when to do so.

#### Stock to the Plan

The New ROI program lays out the rules ahead of time. Those rules are strict and never varied or broken. Stop-loss is the epitome of winning by not losing. This unwavering rules-based approach to investing takes into account behavioral science, and **removes the emotional responses and biases from your investment decisions**. It keeps your retirement portfolio on track to grow and maintain the level of gains necessary to help ensure reliability of income in retirement—over your entire retirement.

### Real Diversification for Today's Real World: Sectiors and Choices

Even portfolios linked to venerable index-based equities may not provide true diversification or protection. So, rather than diversification, your portfolio ends up hopelessly mired in interdependent connections that react accordingly in the event of market ups and downs.

![](<https://s3.amazonaws.com/qp-review/slash-retirement-risk-8.3.png>)

Sector Weightings (%) as of 9/30/2017 and correlations to the S&P 500 (2000-2015)

| Sector        | Weighting | Correlation |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Consum. Disc. | 12%       | 0.87        |
| Consum. Stap. | 8%        | 0.65        |
| Energy        | 6%        | 0.65        |
| Financials    | 15%       | 0.85        |
| Healthcare    | 14%       | 0.80        |
| Industrials   | 10%       | 0.92        |
| Technology    | 24%       | 0.86        |
| Materials     | 3%        | 0.83        |
| Telecoms      | 2%        | 0.76        |
| Utilities     | 3%        | 0.52        |
| REITs         | 3%        | 0.64        |

Now compare that with the typical building blocks used for diversification: growth, value, and international asset classes. The average correlation with the S&P for all three is 92 percent. That means they move with the market 92 percent of the time—hence they offer very little diversification.

Again, in that 2000 technology bubble, the S&P was highly vulnerable to a loss because of its heavy weighting toward technology. When the bubble burst, the S&P lost 9 percent in 2000 alone, primarily the result of the 36 percent drop in technology stocks. Meanwhile, a portfolio with equally weighted sector allocations—the New ROI—gained slightly.

>  Equal sector weighting is the New ROI’s first line of defense to protect your portfolio from the natural bubbles that can and do occur in various sectors.

## Part III - What Works for You

### There's No Such Thing as "Fee-Free" Investing: How to Keep Fees Low

Based on its research, **the average cost per trade was $8.90**, with the highest of $19.95 charged by T. Rowe Price, and lowest at $4.95 for both TradeKing and OptionsHouse. Broker-assisted fees were much higher: the average at $30.99, with the highest at $55 from TIAA-CREF, and the lowest $19.95 from Sharebuilder and Firstrade.

#### The ETF Advantage

As Sam and Cindy discovered, ETFs, with their lower fees, enhance a portfolio’s growth potential and your nest egg’s bottom line. Let’s look more closely at some of the reasons why I prefer ETFs as the best investments for your New ROI portfolio.

ETFs most often track an index, a commodity, bonds, asset class, or sector. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are more liquid because they’re traded like an ordinary equity with intra-day price fluctuations.
