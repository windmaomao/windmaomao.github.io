# The Intelligent Investor













## Introduction

Through all their vicissitudes and casualties, as earth-shaking as they were unforeseen, it remained true that sound investment principles produced generally sound results. We must act on the assumption that they will continue to do so.

Once you ==lose 95% of your money, you have to gain 1,900%== just to get back to where you started. Taking a foolish risk can put you so deep in the hole that it’s virtually impossible to get out.

Graham defines the term—and he makes it clear that this kind of intelligence has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. **It simply means being patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to harness your emotions and think for yourself.** This kind of intelligence, explains Graham, “is a trait ==more of the character than of the brain==.”
