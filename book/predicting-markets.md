# Predicting The Markets
A Professional Autobiography {.subtitle}

## Introduction

Books don’t usually come with theme songs. But if I had to pick one for my professional autobiography, it would be “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” (1988), written and sung by Bobby McFerrin. During the 40 years that I have spent on Wall Street as an economist and investment strategist, investors benefited from great bull markets in both stocks and bonds. Yet instead of being happy, it seemed to me that most investors were worried for most of that time.

> In your life, expect some trouble; When you worry, you make it double.

Such emotionally driven market timing would surely cause one to conclude that investing in stocks is for suckers. However, when the pessimists sold near the bottoms, they created lots of buying opportunities for the optimists.

Fortuitously, during these two coincident great bull markets in bonds and stocks, I was bullish most of the time, especially when most investors and prognosticators were extremely gloomy. Admittedly, there were times when I should have been bearish, or more bearish. In my meetings with investors, I usually warned them that I tend to be an optimist, because I had a happy childhood. In any event, for most investors, getting the bullish long-term trend right and seizing opportunities to buy has been a winning strategy for many years. It certainly has been a “long good buy” for stock and bond investors, as I frequently predicted.

I hope that my experiences on Wall Street, which this book is all about, might help guide your investment decisions with a better understanding of financial markets. The first chapter is “Predicting the Past,” while the final chapter is “Predicting the Future.” In between, I discuss all the lessons I have learned over the past four decades about forecasting the economy and financial markets. **My major conclusion is that while there will always be plenty of worries requiring our attention, the next four decades should bring happy returns to investors who correctly predict the major long-term trends and use any setbacks along the way as buying opportunities.**

When I analyze the relevant data, I do so with charts. I believe that a simple, well-constructed chart can be worth a thousand words, as the saying goes. There are more than 700 charts referenced in what follows. All are posted on the book’s website, yardenibook.com. These charts provide clear graphic support for the discussions that follow. Readers seeking a solid grounding in current analysis should study them carefully. Many of the charts start from when the data are available and go through the end of 2016. That’s the year I chose to end most of my narrative, though 2017 does sneak into a few of the stories and charts on occasion.

## 1. Predicting the Past

Looking  back over my career to date, I've been a macroeconomist, prognosticator, Baby Boomer, microeconomist, strategist, portfolio manager, symbolist, entrepreneurial capitalist, and movie reviewer. I continue to combine all these perspectives to predict the markets by connecting the dots.

## 2. Predicting the World

> Like econmies, people's lives evolve in ways you can't easily predict.

This is how Jonathan Laing summed it up in a 1997 Barron’s article about my forecasts:

> According to the economist, the Cold War created a huge barrier to trade, hindering the untrammeled interplay of free-market forces around the globe. As a consequence, productivity and social welfare suffered from less-than-optimal allocation of capital and labor. Vast resources had to be wasted on military spending, for example.
> The triumph of capitalism and free trade in recent years has created the first truly global market in human history, Yardeni adds. And with the creation of this vastly expanded marketplace come the benefits that Smith wrote of more than 200 years ago. **Fierce competition among producers and accessibility to cheaper labor lower the prices of goods and services.** Larger markets also promote increased productivity and efficiency by allowing for enhanced specialization and division of labor over a wider spectrum of products. This pursuit of comparative advantage redounds to the benefit of all nations and consumers.

Following the end of the Cold War, much of my research focused on the bullish consequences of globalization, i.e., the integration of national economies through free trade. That can only occur during periods that are relatively peaceful on a global basis. The proliferation of free trade following the end of the Cold War clearly has increased global prosperity by fostering economic progress as global competition stimulated innovations. Consumers around the world have benefited the most because they have been provided with more and better products at lower prices. Their standards of living have improved. They’ve prospered.

==History shows that periods of globalization, even very long ones, don’t last forever.==

### Economic consequences of the peace

This outbreak of protectionist sentiments reminded me of a similar outbreak during the late 1920s and early 1930s; I compared the two in my September 1985 Topical Study, “The Protectionist Road to Depression.”

Nevertheless, the 1920s was a period of globalization, with peace, progress, and prosperity. Yet by the early 1930s, the world fell into a depression that was followed by World War II near the end of the decade.

The tariff triggered a deflationary spiral that had a deadly domino effect. Other countries immediately retaliated by imposing tariffs too. The collapse of world trade pushed commodity prices over a cliff. Exporters and farmers defaulted on their loans, triggering a wave of banking crises. The resulting credit crunch caused industrial production and farm output to plunge and unemployment to soar. In my narrative, the depression caused the stock market crash, not the other way around as is the popular belief.

- **Trade.** Data compiled by the League of Nations show that imports of 75 countries dropped 55% from June 1930 through March 1933.
- **Prices.** The producer price index (PPI) for industrial commodity prices plummeted 24% from June 1930 until it bottomed during April 1933.
- **Loans and deposits.** Commercial bank deposits fell 36% from $43 billion during 1929 to $27 billion during 1933. Deposits frozen at suspended commercial banks rose sharply during the three banking panics from 1930 to 1933.
- **Unemployment.** The unemployment rate for nonfarm employees soared from 5.3% during 1929 to peak at a record high of 37.6% during 1933.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 47.9% from its record high of 381 on September 3, 1929 to the year’s low of 199 on November 13 (Fig. 8). From there, it rebounded 48.0% to 294 on April 17, 1930. It was down only 5.1% on a year-over-year basis, suggesting that the Great Crash wasn’t so great! But the worst was ahead, as the stock market started to anticipate the passage of the tariff bill, despite a letter printed in the May 5, 1930 issue of The New York Times signed by 1,028 economists who opposed the bill. The DJIA proceed to fall by 86.0% from the April 17, 1930 high to the low of 41 on July 8, 1932. That was the Great Crash indeed!

> “But although Smoot–Hawley was not entirely responsible for the massive outbreak of protectionism in the early 1930s, it certainly contributed to the climate in which such policies flourished. Smoot–Hawley clearly inspired retaliatory moves against the United States, particularly—but not exclusively—by Canada. This retaliation had a significant effect in reducing US exports. Even worse, Smoot–Hawley generated ill-will around the world and led to widespread discrimination against US exports.”

It is often said that one’s views about the French Revolution reflect one’s political leanings: liberals tend to believe that it was a liberating experience, while conservatives view it as a template for political and social chaos. Similarly, in the United States, opinions on the Great Depression are radically different among liberals and conservatives. The former believe that it was caused by market failures and insufficient demand, requiring more government involvement in the economy. **Conservatives believe that the government’s protectionism and other market-distorting policies caused the depression; the government then responded to the resulting crisis by increasing its power over the economy.** I am in the latter camp.

### Multilateral world order

> My major premise is that the collapse of the Berlin Wall marked the end of the 50-Year Modern Day War, which includes World War II, the Cold War, and numerous regional wars from Korea to Vietnam to Central America to Southern Africa and numerous other hot spots around the world. My major thesis is that this war, which lasted half a century, was in its effect an unprecedented trade barrier. Americans were prohibited from trading with communist countries. The Iron Curtain was a major obstacle to trade between all countries on opposite sides of the curtain. The lifting of the curtain, the destruction of the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of Soviet imperial communism all simultaneously heralded the elimination of the world’s greatest barrier to trade.

Donald Trump won the presidential election on November 8, 2016. He did so to an important extent because he promised to bring jobs back to the United States by either renegotiating trade agreements or imposing tariffs if necessary. His policies could pose a threat to global trade. However, the threat level seems more like what it was during the Reagan years than the debacle of the Hoover administration. Reagan succeeded in promoting fairer trade and bringing back lots of jobs in the auto industry as foreign manufacturers moved some of their production facilities to the United States.

Trump might also succeed in forcing some of America’s trading partners to eliminate unfair trade practices. His approach is bilateral rather than multilateral, which is a different approach to negotiating free trade deals than the one that has prevailed since World War II. That’s alright by me as long as the result is free trade. All the better if it is also fair trade.

### China opens  the door

I started writing about the growing importance of China to the global economy in a February 4, 2003 Topical Study titled “A Bullish Post-War Scenario.” I predicted that Chinese demand would likely push commodity prices higher.16 I observed that the Chinese were building superhighways everywhere. They were encouraging their people to trade in their bicycles for cars. They were expanding their regional airports and ordering more jets.

I reported that roughly 70% of China’s energy came from domestic coal, which is highly polluting. The Chinese were scrambling to acquire more oil from Russia. They were doing the same for liquefied natural gas from Australia and Indonesia. Obviously, oil and gas were not the only commodities in short supply in China; the country also needed a great deal more copper, steel, rubber, platinum, and plastics. I concluded that “one of the most obvious ways to play China is to buy commodities and commodity producers.”

I explained that rapidly increasing farm productivity in China was causing a huge migration from the agrarian sector to the cities. To avoid massive social upheaval, the Chinese needed to create lots of jobs in manufacturing, construction, and services. Joining the WTO was seen as an essential way to create more factory jobs among exporters. I wrote in that second China Topical Study: “I believe that China is driven by a ‘Growth Imperative.’ I believe the country must grow rapidly to absorb the huge number of new entrants into the labor force every year and to meet the needs of the large number of people who are leaving the rural areas and moving to the urban centers.”18 The government fully realized that failure to expand employment could have serious consequences for the country’s social and political stability.

I bolstered my argument by focusing on China’s demography, which has played a much bigger role in China’s economy than in any other. That’s because China has had the biggest population in the world. Economists usually ignore demographic factors because they tend to play out over long periods. In China’s case, demographic factors are among the most important in assessing the country’s economy. They remain very important in explaining why China is likely to continue growing faster than most other countries for a while but then slow significantly. They say that demography is destiny. This certainly applies to China:

- Population. The country’s population has soared from 542 million in 1949 to 1.4 billion in 2016 (Fig. 19). It first exceeded one billion during 1982, coinciding with the government’s push to modernize the economy. The 10-year growth rate peaked around 3% at an annual rate during the first half of the 1970s, when China’s population had swelled by roughly 200 million people over the previous 10 years.
- Rural migration. The population explosion was exacerbated by the huge migration from rural to urban areas. The percentage of the population living in rural communities dropped from 89% during 1950 to 82% during 1978, when China announced the Open Door Policy (Fig. 21). Then it fell to 62% in 2001, when China joined the WTO, and tumbled to 43% by 2016.
- Urbanization. The percentage of the population that was urbanized rose to 50% during 2010 and was 57% in 2016. The urban population increased by 21.8 million that year (Fig. 22). That is truly extraordinary, as this category has been increasing consistently around 20 million per year since 1996. To urbanize that many people requires the equivalent of building a Houston, Texas per month! I made that point in my 2004 study.
- Aging. China’s long-term demographic outlook is not so bright. The government responded to the country’s population explosion by introducing a one-child policy in 1979. That did slow the 10-year growth rate in China’s population from a peak of 3.0% at an annual rate during 1972 to 0.5% in 2016. However, it also led to a shortage of young adult workers and a rapidly aging population. So the government reversed course, with a two-child policy effective January 1, 2016. The move was most likely too little too late. By 2050, the primary working-age population in China is projected to represent less than half of the total population, below a peak of 62% during 2011.

### Brief world tour

In 1986, reflecting the growing interest in global investing, Morgan Stanley licensed from Capital International the rights to global stock indexes that covered non-US markets and branded them as the “Morgan Stanley Capital International” (“MSCI”) indexes. The MSCI indexes were the primary benchmark indexes outside of the United States for several years before being joined by those of FTSE, Citibank, and Standard & Poor’s. The MSCI global equity indexes have been calculated since 1969.

There are plenty of data for individual countries, but anyone looking for aggregate global data finds slim pickings. Nevertheless, there are enough of both for a reasonably well-informed assessment of the global economy:


Production indexes. 

: For starters, the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis has been compiling a monthly series on world industrial production since 1991 (Fig. 25). Because it is based on so many national production indexes, the latest updates tend to be three months old. Production per se is a coincident indicator, but this production statistic is a lagging one because of its delayed availability.
: The interesting story is in the two subindexes for production in the advanced economies and in the emerging ones (Fig. 26). From the start of 1991 through the end of 2016, the former rose just 33%, while the latter soared 257%!

Export measures. 

: The CPB compiles a seasonally adjusted data series for the volume of world exports as well (Fig. 28). It is available monthly since 1991. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has a similar series for the value of world exports, denominated in dollars (Fig. 29). It starts in 1950. This series is very volatile on a monthly basis because it is not seasonally adjusted. A related current-dollar exports data series is available for the Group of Seven (G7) industrial economies, on a monthly and seasonally adjusted basis since 1993
: I like to squeeze as much information as I can from the data, primarily by identifying relationships among available series. The ratio of G7 exports to world exports (both in current dollars) dropped from 52.5% at the start of 1994 to 32.2% at the end of 2015 (Fig. 32). In other words, the exports of the rest of the world grew more rapidly, accounting for more global business as emerging economies emerged.

Purchasing managers’ surveys. 

: The data series I just reviewed are useful for monitoring the trends in the global economy. Only the daily commodity index is available with the high frequency necessary to get a read on the current condition of the global economy. On a monthly basis, numerous business activity indexes are compiled from surveys of purchasing managers around the world. They all are diffusion indexes showing whether, on balance, purchasing managers reported that production, orders, employment, and numerous other variables were better or worse during the latest month than the previous month. The data vendors provide seasonally adjusted series for these along with overall business indexes, which reflect the movements of some of the key subindexes.

Leading economic indicators. 

: The OECD does compile lots of leading economic indicators for each of its 35 members of advanced economies, along with a composite index representing all of them together (Fig. 36 and Fig. 37). The organization does the same for the four BRICs (Fig. 38). Leading indicators are supposed to lead the economy by at least three months. The problem is that the data usually are released with a lag of a couple of months. Nevertheless, I do track them to see whether they either confirm or contradict the other available data.

Eurozone.

: Near the end of every month, the European Commission issues a press release with numerous indexes compiled from a business and consumer survey conducted throughout the European Union.21 I focus on the Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) for the Eurozone because it is highly correlated with the year-over-year growth rate in real GDP for the region (Fig. 39). It did a great job of signaling the 2011–2013 slump and the subdued growth rate during 2014 and 2015. It then correctly showed improving growth during the second half of 2016 and 2017.

Germany. 

: I’m a big fan of the IFO Business Climate Index, reported monthly by Germany’s IFO Institute (Fig. 42).23 It has been an extremely cyclical and reliable indicator of business activity in Germany. It includes two subcomponents tracking current conditions and expectations. Since Germany is such an export powerhouse, business conditions in the country are especially useful for assessing the global economy. However, the remarkable improvement during 2017 to new record highs for the headline index might also reflect the stimulative impact of massive immigration during 2015 and 2016.

Japan. 

: Japan is also an export powerhouse. However, the country is very strict about immigration, and domestic consumer demand is weighed down by aging demographic trends. With this in mind, I’ve observed that Japan’s industrial production index was remarkably flat from 2010 through 2016, signaling that from the country’s perspective, foreign demand for its manufactured products has been weighed down by weak domestic demand.

South Korea and Taiwan. 

: Japan also faces competition from other manufacturers around the world, especially South Korea and Taiwan. The exports of these two are heavily weighted toward industrial and high-tech products.

China. 

: Early each month, China releases data for its aggregate exports and imports during the previous month. These are very timely data for assessing the global economy as well as China’s economy. I use seasonally adjusted data to do this (Fig. 45). Even so, the data can be volatile. Their accuracy has often been questioned, along with the accuracy of most of the other statistical series reported by the Chinese government. That’s why I like to find correlations that confirm or raise doubts about the information provided by any one series. In this case, I’ve found that the sum of China’s imports and exports is highly correlated with the monthly series available for railways freight traffic.

The economics division of the IMF, in Washington, DC, publishes the biannual World Economic Outlook (WEO), which is released usually in April and September/October. Short updates are provided during January and July. The first chapter in the biannual publications provides an overview as well as a more detailed analysis of the world economy. Subsequent chapters cover issues “affecting industrial countries, developing countries, and economies in transition to market; and address topics of pressing current interest.” The main issue covered is highlighted on the cover page of the report. For example, the October 2015 WEO was titled “Adjusting to Lower Commodity Prices.” (See Appendix 2.2, World Economic Outlook: 1998–Present.)

### Global synchronized booms, busts, and stagnation

The Unitied Staes is the 800-pound gorilla in the global economy. So the data show that the United States may not be as coupled to the world economy as everyone else is coupled to the United States. However, that has been chaning since the global financial crisis of 2008.

Let's take a quick look back at how synchronized the global economy has been over the past several decades:

- During the 1930s, there was a period of a global synchronized depression, though some countries recovered from it sooner than the United States.
- During the 1940s, war and reconstruction occurred. After the war, the United States emerged as the sole superpower and focused on rebuilding Europe and reviving Japan.
- During the 1950s and 1960s, the US economy was driven by the expansion of the highway system, which led to the suburbanization of America.
- During the 1970s, the US economy experienced a couple of oil supply shocks that triggered severe recessions. America had become very dependent on foreign oil suppliers.
- During the 1980s, the United States experienced growing competition from Japan, triggering a wave of corporate restructurings and the start of “deindustrialization” as companies increasingly moved production overseas to lower their labor costs. Later in the decade, that trend was somewhat reversed as Japanese and other foreign manufacturers opened factories in the United States, particularly in the South, where labor costs were relatively low.
- During the 1990s, the United States emerged as the sole superpower again after the end of the Cold War. Japan’s bubble had burst at the start of the decade, and the Japanese economy sputtered. Europe was struggling to revive economic growth throughout the decade, and the emerging economies stumbled near the end of the decade. The US economy managed to decouple from the rest of the world thanks to the “peace dividend” and the boom in the domestic high-tech industry.
- During the 2000s, some emerging economies had emerged, led by China. The United States inflated a housing bubble. The Eurozone’s monetary union stimulated an economic boom fueled by borrowing and lending binges. It was a period that stood out as a bona fide global synchronized boom. Unfortunately, the boom didn’t last long and ended very badly in 2008, when a worldwide financial crisis triggered a severe global recession. It was a synchronized bust.
- During the 2010s, the global economy continued the recovery that had started in 2009 as the world’s major central banks provided ultra-easy monetary conditions. However, following a typical V-shaped recovery around the world, global economic growth was very sluggish from 2011 through 2016.

The term “secular stagnation” came into vogue to describe the performance of the global economy following the economic recovery of 2009 and 2010. Economic growth was weaker than widely expected. A few economists warned that economic growth could simply stall. Central banks provided plenty of monetary rocket fuel in an effort to achieve “escape velocity,” i.e., fast enough growth that monetary policy would no longer require the rocket fuel. Nevertheless, the IMF’s economists had to lower their forecast for global economic activity in every one of their WEOs from 2011 through 2016. Consider the following developments:

- Japan. In many ways, Japan is the poster child of a modern industrial economy that is struggling with secular stagnation. The government has tried numerous rounds of fiscal and monetary stimulus without much success. The problem is a rapidly aging population that is also shrinking. Japan “is currently the oldest nation in the world and is projected to retain this position through at least 2050,” notes a March 2016 Census Bureau report titled An Aging World: 2015. Japan’s elderly population percentage increased from 12% in 1990 to 25% in 2014. The working-age population percentage fell from 69% to 62% over this same period. The gap between Japan’s number of deaths and number of births has continued to widen since deaths first exceeded births in July 2007. As a result, Japan’s population has declined by 1.1 million since then, as of May 2017.
- United States. The recovery in US consumer spending was relatively weak in the post-crisis expansion through 2016 compared to in previous expansions. The rebound in the housing market remained lackluster too. Unlike the Baby Boomers, Millennials have preferred to remain single longer and to rent apartments in cities. They’ve been in no rush to get married, move to their own homes in the suburbs, and have kids. The upturn in capital spending was subpar as businesses remained cautious following the traumatic recession. There was an energy boom, but it turned into a bust during the second half of 2014 through early 2016. As a result, from 2011 through 2016, real GDP growth on a year-over-year basis fluctuated around 2.0%, which in the past was the stall speed that led to a recession.
- Eurozone. In the Eurozone, debt that had accumulated during the previous boom weighed on the economy. Loans held by monetary financial institutions remained essentially flat from 2009 through 2016 after increasing by €4.0 trillion from the start of 2003 through the end of 2008. The region’s industrial production, which had recovered smartly during 2009 and 2010, increased only 2.0% from the start of 2011 through the end of 2016.
- China. China’s real GDP growth rate peaked during 2007 as a result of too much debt and excess capacity (Fig. 53). The Chinese government responded to the global economic crisis of 2008 by increasing fiscal spending and stimulating bank lending. From December 2008 through September 2017, Chinese bank loans quadrupled from 30.3 trillion yuan ($4.4 trillion) to 117.8 trillion yuan ($17.9 trillion). Apparently, that financed lots of excess manufacturing capacity, as evidenced by the decline in the PPI on a year-over-year basis for 54 months from March 2012 to August 2016. However, by late 2016 and early 2017, the PPI inflation rate had rebounded significantly, suggesting that some excess capacity might have been reduced and that demand might have been boosted by another round of easy credit.
- Old world. Around the world, aging populations seemed to be contributing to secular stagnation as people lived longer and fertility rates dropped below the population replacement rate. The March 2016 Census Bureau report cited above estimated that 9% of the 7.3 billion people worldwide (or 617.1 million) in 2015 were aged 65 or older.27 The number of older people was projected to increase more than 60% by 2030, to about one billion older people globally, equivalent to 12% of the total population. The report projected that by 2050, there will be 1.6 billion older people worldwide, representing 16% of the total world population of 9.8 billion. **Older people tend to be more conservative spenders than younger ones, particularly midlifers with kids to feed, clothe, house, and educate.**

This very brief overview of secular stagnation suggests that **the sources of the problem are debt, deflation, and demographics**. Too much debt accumulated in the past reduces the effectiveness of easy monetary and fiscal policies in stimulating demand. If some of that debt leads to excessive capacity expansion, the result is deflation, which is bad for profits. **The persistence of easy money in this situation can worsen deflation by propping up excess capacity.** Yes, easy money can be deflationary! The demographic sources of secular stagnation may be more intractable than either debt or deflation.

> "We believe that this is largely due to lower optimism about the future, more specifically to downward revisions in growth forecasts, rather than to the legacies of the past. Put simply, demand is temporarily weak because people are adjusting to a less bright future."

I’m inclined to agree with Rogoff and Blanchard. Indeed, there was mounting evidence of better economic growth around the world in late 2016 and throughout 2017, though some of that strength might have reflected the end of the recession in the global energy industry that started in mid-2014 and lasted through early 2016. The improvement was reflected in the titles of the biannual WEO, from “Too Slow for Too Long” (April 2016) to “Gaining Momentum” (April 2017).

### Globalization and its discontented

Globalization takes the individual’s conflicting desires for freedom, on the one hand, and for order, on the other hand, to a global level, exacerbating discontent on a worldwide scale. During periods of social and political chaos, particularly during war times, everyone is equally miserable. No one is particularly incensed about income inequality. In totalitarian societies, where brute force is used to establish social and political order, there is lots of income equality. Everyone except the ruling junta is equally poor. During peacetimes, globalization increases prosperity. The rich certainly can get richer, but all consumers benefit from the availability of better goods and services at lower prices thanks to freer trade. Globalization is an income-leveling force, increasing income equality because it increases the purchasing power of consumers broadly and indiscriminately.

However, globalization also entails production shifts from high-wage to low-wage countries. On balance, that too increases income equality, as more workers are likely to benefit in the low-wage countries than are likely to be harmed in the high-wage countries. Nevertheless, the latter group of workers undoubtedly will be very discontented with the adverse consequences of globalization hitting them. For them, the pain of losing a job or accepting a pay cut outweighs the gain of lower prices at the mall.

In democracies, populist politicians then step in, doing what they always do. They pander to the anxiety of the discontented and inflame them with anti-globalization rhetoric. In totalitarian regimes, dictators incite ultra-nationalist sentiments to mask the failure of their regimes to allow their subjects to benefit from globalization. As it gets harder to hide the benefits that others are enjoying in other countries, the classic response of despots is to resort to nationalist propaganda, blaming foreigners for their people’s misery.

Another important lesson is that economists and historians can analyze the same data and facts yet come to completely different conclusions. All I can do is study their work to sort out the debate among them. Then I look at the data and the facts and come to my own hopefully well-informed conclusion.

## 3. Predicting Technology and Productivity
