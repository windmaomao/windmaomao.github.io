# Predicting The Markets
A Professional Autobiography {.subtitle}

## Introduction

Books don’t usually come with theme songs. But if I had to pick one for my professional autobiography, it would be “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” (1988), written and sung by Bobby McFerrin. During the 40 years that I have spent on Wall Street as an economist and investment strategist, investors benefited from great bull markets in both stocks and bonds. Yet instead of being happy, it seemed to me that most investors were worried for most of that time.

> In your life, expect some trouble; When you worry, you make it double.

Such emotionally driven market timing would surely cause one to conclude that investing in stocks is for suckers. However, when the pessimists sold near the bottoms, they created lots of buying opportunities for the optimists.

Fortuitously, during these two coincident great bull markets in bonds and stocks, I was bullish most of the time, especially when most investors and prognosticators were extremely gloomy. Admittedly, there were times when I should have been bearish, or more bearish. In my meetings with investors, I usually warned them that I tend to be an optimist, because I had a happy childhood. In any event, for most investors, getting the bullish long-term trend right and seizing opportunities to buy has been a winning strategy for many years. It certainly has been a “long good buy” for stock and bond investors, as I frequently predicted.

I hope that my experiences on Wall Street, which this book is all about, might help guide your investment decisions with a better understanding of financial markets. The first chapter is “Predicting the Past,” while the final chapter is “Predicting the Future.” In between, I discuss all the lessons I have learned over the past four decades about forecasting the economy and financial markets. **My major conclusion is that while there will always be plenty of worries requiring our attention, the next four decades should bring happy returns to investors who correctly predict the major long-term trends and use any setbacks along the way as buying opportunities.**

When I analyze the relevant data, I do so with charts. I believe that a simple, well-constructed chart can be worth a thousand words, as the saying goes. There are more than 700 charts referenced in what follows. All are posted on the book’s website, yardenibook.com. These charts provide clear graphic support for the discussions that follow. Readers seeking a solid grounding in current analysis should study them carefully. Many of the charts start from when the data are available and go through the end of 2016. That’s the year I chose to end most of my narrative, though 2017 does sneak into a few of the stories and charts on occasion.

## 1. Predicting the Past

Looking  back over my career to date, I've been a macroeconomist, prognosticator, Baby Boomer, microeconomist, strategist, portfolio manager, symbolist, entrepreneurial capitalist, and movie reviewer. I continue to combine all these perspectives to predict the markets by connecting the dots.

## 2. Predicting the World

> Like econmies, people's lives evolve in ways you can't easily predict.

This is how Jonathan Laing summed it up in a 1997 Barron’s article about my forecasts:

> According to the economist, the Cold War created a huge barrier to trade, hindering the untrammeled interplay of free-market forces around the globe. As a consequence, productivity and social welfare suffered from less-than-optimal allocation of capital and labor. Vast resources had to be wasted on military spending, for example.
> The triumph of capitalism and free trade in recent years has created the first truly global market in human history, Yardeni adds. And with the creation of this vastly expanded marketplace come the benefits that Smith wrote of more than 200 years ago. **Fierce competition among producers and accessibility to cheaper labor lower the prices of goods and services.** Larger markets also promote increased productivity and efficiency by allowing for enhanced specialization and division of labor over a wider spectrum of products. This pursuit of comparative advantage redounds to the benefit of all nations and consumers.

Following the end of the Cold War, much of my research focused on the bullish consequences of globalization, i.e., the integration of national economies through free trade. That can only occur during periods that are relatively peaceful on a global basis. The proliferation of free trade following the end of the Cold War clearly has increased global prosperity by fostering economic progress as global competition stimulated innovations. Consumers around the world have benefited the most because they have been provided with more and better products at lower prices. Their standards of living have improved. They’ve prospered.

==History shows that periods of globalization, even very long ones, don’t last forever.==

### Economic consequences of the peace

This outbreak of protectionist sentiments reminded me of a similar outbreak during the late 1920s and early 1930s; I compared the two in my September 1985 Topical Study, “The Protectionist Road to Depression.”

Nevertheless, the 1920s was a period of globalization, with peace, progress, and prosperity. Yet by the early 1930s, the world fell into a depression that was followed by World War II near the end of the decade.

The tariff triggered a deflationary spiral that had a deadly domino effect. Other countries immediately retaliated by imposing tariffs too. The collapse of world trade pushed commodity prices over a cliff. Exporters and farmers defaulted on their loans, triggering a wave of banking crises. The resulting credit crunch caused industrial production and farm output to plunge and unemployment to soar. In my narrative, the depression caused the stock market crash, not the other way around as is the popular belief.

- **Trade.** Data compiled by the League of Nations show that imports of 75 countries dropped 55% from June 1930 through March 1933.
- **Prices.** The producer price index (PPI) for industrial commodity prices plummeted 24% from June 1930 until it bottomed during April 1933.
- **Loans and deposits.** Commercial bank deposits fell 36% from $43 billion during 1929 to $27 billion during 1933. Deposits frozen at suspended commercial banks rose sharply during the three banking panics from 1930 to 1933.
- **Unemployment.** The unemployment rate for nonfarm employees soared from 5.3% during 1929 to peak at a record high of 37.6% during 1933.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 47.9% from its record high of 381 on September 3, 1929 to the year’s low of 199 on November 13 (Fig. 8). From there, it rebounded 48.0% to 294 on April 17, 1930. It was down only 5.1% on a year-over-year basis, suggesting that the Great Crash wasn’t so great! But the worst was ahead, as the stock market started to anticipate the passage of the tariff bill, despite a letter printed in the May 5, 1930 issue of The New York Times signed by 1,028 economists who opposed the bill. The DJIA proceed to fall by 86.0% from the April 17, 1930 high to the low of 41 on July 8, 1932. That was the Great Crash indeed!

> “But although Smoot–Hawley was not entirely responsible for the massive outbreak of protectionism in the early 1930s, it certainly contributed to the climate in which such policies flourished. Smoot–Hawley clearly inspired retaliatory moves against the United States, particularly—but not exclusively—by Canada. This retaliation had a significant effect in reducing US exports. Even worse, Smoot–Hawley generated ill-will around the world and led to widespread discrimination against US exports.”
