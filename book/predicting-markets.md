# Predicting The Markets
A Professional Autobiography {.subtitle}

## Introduction

Books don’t usually come with theme songs. But if I had to pick one for my professional autobiography, it would be “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” (1988), written and sung by Bobby McFerrin. During the 40 years that I have spent on Wall Street as an economist and investment strategist, investors benefited from great bull markets in both stocks and bonds. Yet instead of being happy, it seemed to me that most investors were worried for most of that time.

Such emotionally driven market timing would surely cause one to conclude that investing in stocks is for suckers. However, when the pessimists sold near the bottoms, they created lots of buying opportunities for the optimists.

Fortuitously, during these two coincident great bull markets in bonds and stocks, I was bullish most of the time, especially when most investors and prognosticators were extremely gloomy. Admittedly, there were times when I should have been bearish, or more bearish. In my meetings with investors, I usually warned them that I tend to be an optimist, because I had a happy childhood. In any event, for most investors, getting the bullish long-term trend right and seizing opportunities to buy has been a winning strategy for many years. It certainly has been a “long good buy” for stock and bond investors, as I frequently predicted.

I hope that my experiences on Wall Street, which this book is all about, might help guide your investment decisions with a better understanding of financial markets. The first chapter is “Predicting the Past,” while the final chapter is “Predicting the Future.” In between, I discuss all the lessons I have learned over the past four decades about forecasting the economy and financial markets. **My major conclusion is that while there will always be plenty of worries requiring our attention, the next four decades should bring happy returns to investors who correctly predict the major long-term trends and use any setbacks along the way as buying opportunities.**
