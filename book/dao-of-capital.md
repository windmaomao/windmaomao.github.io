Exploiting the Distortion with Misesian Tools 

We ask ourselves: 

- How are we exposed to malinvestment? Are we, for instance, investing in what is most manipulated by, whose profitability is most dependent upon, artificially low interest rates? 
- Beyond avoiding it, can we perhaps even benefit from it?

If this book achieves nothing else, it would more than hit its mark if readers came away with greater awareness of such distortions in the economy and the markets, which magnify the human tendency toward the direct reward of li, and acquired a deeper appreciation for the arduous path of shi. The thought process here is what matters most; it is the real takeaway, a prescription for all investors, as it culminates the overarching theme of this book: **the roundabout of The Dao of Capital as the circuitous means toward the ends of productive capital investment, despite our biology and a system rigged against it**.

### Homeostatis En Force

Since the Misesian Stationarity index can reach a lofty level (meaning the economy can persistently deviate from stationarity) only because of monetary distortion, we should expect a very high MS index to act as a prelude to a price of title to existing capital (the stock market, the numerator in the MS index) that is unsustainably high; this follows our expectation that the replacement value of that capital (the denominator in the MS index) will be unresponsive, as further new investment is thwarted by the distortion. Savers and investors, dissatisfied with artificially low interest rates that don’t reflect their actual time preferences, placate themselves by eking out yield and otherwise chasing immediate returns (which are themselves given a boost from higher immediate consumption and lower savings from artificially lower rates). They quickly devour the immediate marshmallow in front of them, scoffing at the potential rewards for waiting. The lower rates make otherwise marginal investment schemes look good, and otherwise marginal existing capital (having marginal returns) look suddenly profitable, resulting in a scramble to own it and resulting in persistent market maladjustments. The system becomes starved of capital for roundabout production, as ==capital is trapped in the present—consuming itself==, as it were—and thus there are insufficient resources to support the ongoing illusion of economic progress.

It only stands to reason that the stock market should inevitably fall (and fall in a violent, concentrated manner) as investors are routed into immediate liquidation altogether; existing capital is priced too high relative to its ultimate profitability, and all the monetary delusions of grandeur are simultaneously revealed in a burst of highly correlated entrepreneurial error.

### Witness to the Distortion

Now for some housekeeping: As discussed in Chapter 7, the MS index is very well represented by what is known as the (Tobin’s) Equity Q ratio—total U.S. corporate equity divided by total U.S. corporate net worth—which is readily available online through numerous sources, and easily computable using Federal Reserve Flow of Funds balance sheet data (and it is the height of irony that the very institution at the root of the distortion, the recognition of which is the point of the MS index, provides the data necessary to calculate it).

The next and most pertinent question: What is the real effect of this distortion on the numerator (the aggregate land expectation value if this were taking place in our Nibelungenland, and the aggregate stock market capitalization in our real economy)? Let’s start by examining **the total excess returns (the return, including dividends, in excess of the one-year “risk free” treasury rate) of the S&P Composite Index** (the biggest, most closely watched, and most heavily traded and well recorded capitalization-weighted U.S. stock index, a very good proxy for the total corporate equity of the MS index) following different regimes of monetary distortion since the turn of the twentieth century.

Based on what we now know, we would expect to see an inverse relationship: When the MS index is low, the subsequent average stock return should be high; when the MS index is high, the subsequent average return should be low.

What’s driving these return differentials? Do stocks merely drift up at steeper rates under low MS index levels than under high ones, or is there something else going on? Of course we would expect to see the indications of severe malinvestment liquidation driving these results, meaning severe subsequent stock market losses (and we’ll look at the concentration or speed of such losses a bit later).

What a financially distorted world tells us is that the market, just like the overgrown forest, carries within it the seeds of its destructive correction; thus the inevitable bust that follows the boom is not (or at least should not be) an unexpected event. This is a very important realization, something of a death blow to the concept of systemic risk, and which will become the backbone of the Austrian Investing I rationale (and without which we would be left as mere victims of the distorted market and seemingly random shocks).

### An Initial Misesian Investment Strategy

 A quick and dirty scan of the MS index chart (Figure 9.1) tells us that, say, a reading of 1.6 and, say, of 0.7 were historically generally high and low levels—so likely good places to sell and buy stocks, respectively. And when we’ve sold out of our stocks, we buy one-month treasury bills and roll them each month until we buy back into the stock market. How would that have done? (There is a good deal of ex post information in this strategy, because we didn’t know what constituted a good MS index level at which to sell or buy until it was all over, of course. However, it turns out—not surprisingly—that’s not a concern: If I instead start my test after, say, 1925—the first complete cycle—rather than 1901, and use only the information known at the time from then on, I get equivalent results. No cheating.)

 The Misesian strategy outperforms the stock market by more than two percentage points per year. Think about what this shows. A basic “toy” strategy (with an “alpha” t-score of well over 4) based solely on an easily calculatable and logical measure of market distortion beats not only the average professional stock picker (who consistently underperforms the S&P), but also the (highly survivorship-biased) average hedge fund manager (such as from the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index)—and with far less fanfare and risk. (And, for the record, while others have made attempts at Austrian market indicators of all sorts, none to my knowledge has either had these results nor avoided the lures of arbitrary ex post fitting and spurious relationships.)
