Exploiting the Distortion with Misesian Tools 

We ask ourselves: 

- How are we exposed to malinvestment? Are we, for instance, investing in what is most manipulated by, whose profitability is most dependent upon, artificially low interest rates? 
- Beyond avoiding it, can we perhaps even benefit from it?

If this book achieves nothing else, it would more than hit its mark if readers came away with greater awareness of such distortions in the economy and the markets, which magnify the human tendency toward the direct reward of _li_, and acquired a deeper appreciation for the arduous path of _shi_. The thought process here is what matters most; it is the real takeaway, a prescription for all investors, as it culminates the overarching theme of this book: **the roundabout of The Dao of Capital as the circuitous means toward the ends of productive capital investment, despite our biology and a system rigged against it**.

### Homeostatis En Force

Since the Misesian Stationarity index can reach a lofty level (meaning the economy can persistently deviate from stationarity) only because of monetary distortion, we should expect a very high MS index to act as a prelude to a price of title to existing capital (the stock market, the numerator in the MS index) that is unsustainably high; this follows our expectation that the replacement value of that capital (the denominator in the MS index) will be unresponsive, as further new investment is thwarted by the distortion. Savers and investors, dissatisfied with artificially low interest rates that don’t reflect their actual time preferences, placate themselves by eking out yield and otherwise chasing immediate returns (which are themselves given a boost from higher immediate consumption and lower savings from artificially lower rates). They quickly devour the immediate marshmallow in front of them, scoffing at the potential rewards for waiting. The lower rates make otherwise marginal investment schemes look good, and otherwise marginal existing capital (having marginal returns) look suddenly profitable, resulting in a scramble to own it and resulting in persistent market maladjustments. The system becomes starved of capital for roundabout production, as ==capital is trapped in the present—consuming itself==, as it were—and thus there are insufficient resources to support the ongoing illusion of economic progress.

It only stands to reason that the stock market should inevitably fall (and fall in a violent, concentrated manner) as investors are routed into immediate liquidation altogether; existing capital is priced too high relative to its ultimate profitability, and all the monetary delusions of grandeur are simultaneously revealed in a burst of highly correlated entrepreneurial error.

### Witness to the Distortion

Now for some housekeeping: As discussed in Chapter 7, the MS index is very well represented by what is known as the (Tobin’s) Equity Q ratio—total U.S. corporate equity divided by total U.S. corporate net worth—which is readily available online through numerous sources, and easily computable using Federal Reserve Flow of Funds balance sheet data (and it is the height of irony that the very institution at the root of the distortion, the recognition of which is the point of the MS index, provides the data necessary to calculate it).

The next and most pertinent question: What is the real effect of this distortion on the numerator (the aggregate land expectation value if this were taking place in our Nibelungenland, and the aggregate stock market capitalization in our real economy)? Let’s start by examining **the total excess returns (the return, including dividends, in excess of the one-year “risk free” treasury rate) of the S&P Composite Index** (the biggest, most closely watched, and most heavily traded and well recorded capitalization-weighted U.S. stock index, a very good proxy for the total corporate equity of the MS index) following different regimes of monetary distortion since the turn of the twentieth century.

Based on what we now know, we would expect to see an inverse relationship: When the MS index is low, the subsequent average stock return should be high; when the MS index is high, the subsequent average return should be low.

What’s driving these return differentials? Do stocks merely drift up at steeper rates under low MS index levels than under high ones, or is there something else going on? Of course we would expect to see the indications of severe malinvestment liquidation driving these results, meaning severe subsequent stock market losses (and we’ll look at the concentration or speed of such losses a bit later).

In the following test I use S&P Composite Index “drawdowns”—or the amount by which our S&P returns cumulatively turn negative during any three-year window before rising again—as a measurement of stock market losses. In bucketing these drawdowns based on the MS index at the start of each period, just as I did in Figure 9.2, we start to uncover the market’s dynamics.

In Figure 9.3, the lowest dark bar indicates the 20th percentile drawdown, or the realized drawdown at which 20 percent of all the data in the bucket are lower, and the light bar above the dark bar is the 50th percentile—also called the “median”—drawdown, or the realized drawdown at which half of all the data in the bucket are lower.

What a financially distorted world tells us is that the market, just like the overgrown forest, carries within it the seeds of its destructive correction; **thus the inevitable bust that follows the boom is not (or at least should not be) an unexpected event**. This is a very important realization, something of a death blow to the concept of systemic risk, and which will become the backbone of the Austrian Investing I rationale (and without which we would be left as mere victims of the distorted market and seemingly random shocks).

### An Initial Misesian Investment Strategy

 A quick and dirty scan of the MS index chart (Figure 9.1) tells us that, say, a reading of 1.6 and, say, of 0.7 were historically generally high and low levels—so likely good places to sell and buy stocks, respectively. And when we’ve sold out of our stocks, we buy one-month treasury bills and roll them each month until we buy back into the stock market. How would that have done? (There is a good deal of ex post information in this strategy, because we didn’t know what constituted a good MS index level at which to sell or buy until it was all over, of course. However, it turns out—not surprisingly—that’s not a concern: If I instead start my test after, say, 1925—the first complete cycle—rather than 1901, and use only the information known at the time from then on, I get equivalent results. No cheating.)

 **The Misesian strategy outperforms the stock market by more than two percentage points per year. Think about what this shows. A basic “toy” strategy (with an “alpha” t-score of well over 4) based solely on an easily calculatable and logical measure of market distortion beats not only the average professional stock picker (who consistently underperforms the S&P), but also the (highly survivorship-biased) average hedge fund manager (such as from the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index)—and with far less fanfare and risk.** (And, for the record, while others have made attempts at Austrian market indicators of all sorts, none to my knowledge has either had these results nor avoided the lures of arbitrary ex post fitting and spurious relationships.)

 The properties of the MS index offer a logical, straightforward, and highly pragmatic guide that most people can follow and understand, acting as a very simple gauge to judge one’s investment theses. And yet it still seems to elude most people—after all, very few people, including professionals, get these kinds of investing results over time. The reason, as you’ve probably deduced by now, is that these returns are only realized in an exceedingly roundabout way; the detour beats the direct route. That is, **it takes the Misesian strategy’s average underperformance duration and magnitude of almost three years and 9 percent annualized to gain the advantages of investing for its eventual 2 percent cumulative outperformance**. (Just imagine still waiting today after two decades to reenter the once-again booming stock market.) It painfully sacrifices immediate profits (as markets become more and more inflated by artificially low rates) most of the time for a tremendous eventual advantage (in buying after they inevitably deflate). It is investing, weiqi-style.

 > In the immediate-marshmallow world of investing, it is so hard to be the one sitting with folded arms, not taking the sweet enticement of now, and focusing instead on intermediate means for positional advantage to be exploited later. In weiqi, it takes great discipline to be _shi_, building only potential that may or may not ever really materialize, while one’s _li_ opponent racks up points and appears to be winning by a sizeable margin. Yet it is a choice that we must make, to take on the roundabout burden of the indirect, retreating now and looking foolish (or worse) to the rest of the world. (Klipp used to have a pithy phrase that embodied the difficulty of being _shi_ in a _li_ world, saying to be successful in trading, one had to “look like a jerk feel like a jerk.” Though, what else would we expect from the man who said you had to love to lose money and hate to make it?) Given all the time we’ve spent in the esteemed company of Laozi and Sun Wu, Bastiat and Clausewitz, Menger, Böhm-Bawerk, Mises, and Ford, why would we not want to apply this thinking for ourselves? Not to do so would seem the ultimate foolishness, to turn our back on this archetypal strategic wisdom.

If you are wondering right now, after eight chapters of the roundabout, if the first investment strategy you are receiving basically tells you to **stay out of the market for long periods of time when distortion is running high**, the answer is yes. Although that may seem anticlimactic, it is anything but. To put this in the most straightforward terms, it’s a really big deal—a very different and contrarian (and highly effective) way to approach investing. Just as Klipp’s Paradox of “love to lose money, hate to make money” led to incredible discipline (and some healthy returns) in the trading pit, so, too, does this Misesian approach in anyone’s portfolio.

The objective of roundabout Austrian Investing is not to find a way to make money now, but to position ourselves for better investment opportunities later. Or, as we might state it, we’re being patient now so that we can be strategically impatient later. Whatever you decide to do as an investor, keep in mind the overarching aim of this book; it is about a way of thinking, of understanding the roundabout and the considerable strategic advantages to be gained along the patient, circuitous path. If you take away nothing else from this chapter (or even from this book) know that there is usually imminent danger in the direct approach, in ignoring the means for the ends, particularly in the market when distortion is running high. Thanks to the Misesian Stationarity index, there is a way to gauge that danger so that, no matter what your investment decisions are, you are better informed about those dangers.

Implementing **this cookie-cutter Misesian strategy is extremely ambitious, even audacious (particularly for professionals)**, as Chapter 6 reminds us, because of that humanness about us that gives us a high immediate time preference—further magnified under monetary intervention—and makes it difficult to impossible to forego the immediate marshmallow, even though we may believe there are a great many more marshmallows to come. Think of the Misesian Wall Street investor (an oddity, to be sure) who shows no excess return during the distortion years when he owns low-yielding T-bills (and dramatically underperforms the stock market as it further runs up); he and his ilk would have mostly been weeded out by natural selection over a year or two of underperformance. No über-hyperbolic discounter will ever get to monetize the 2 percent outperformance of the Misesian strategy (though he would be a wealthy star if he could).

There is yet another challenge in executing this Misesian strategy. It requires contrarian thinking, a not-to-be-underestimated psychological feat, to zig when the rest of the world is zagging—to step aside when the rest of the world is scrambling to buy, and to buy when the rest of the world is bailing out of positions. When the MS index goes so low it falls well below 1, then one can act like a corporate raider (particularly common around the last generational low in the MS index in the early 1980s), scooping up good assets that can then be liquidated at a profit—because in the aftermath of a malinvestment purge, title to capital is available for less than the replacement cost. **Think of a low MS index for a cash-rich investor as analogous to the no longer dormant conifer seeds after their serotinous cones have opened, ready to spread throughout the fire-cleared, competitor-free land, enriched by nutrients of their vanquished predecessors.**
