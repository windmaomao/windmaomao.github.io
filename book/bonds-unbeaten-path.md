# Bonds - The Unbeaten Path to Secure Investment Growth 

## Introduction

The world has changed drastically in the past twenty years. The economic safety net is now frayed. Job security has sharply declined. Company-sponsored pension plans are becoming extinct, and many people worry about the health of the Social Security and Medicare systems. Given these concerns, we all must take responsibility for our own financial well-being.

Bonds can free investors from any fear of investing. Safe bonds will protect your principal and generate substantial after-tax income without subjecting you to the substantial risk inherent in stocks. We believe that bonds will provide as good or better returns than stocks in the future and without substantial volatility. Bonds will also provide growth through the magic of compound interest if you reinvest the income that bonds provide. *Bonds* offers you a way to realize your financial goals and secure your financial future without taking a market risk.

## 1. Bonds The Better Investment

The stated historical return of 10 percent on stocks is merely theoretical because it does not take into account taxes, expenses, and investors' bad timing. It is uncertain that stocks will outperform bonds in the future, and the risk of a severe stock market decline increases as the investment period increases. Stocks are riskier and less predictable than bonds.

Individual investors have a different time line and pockets that are not nearly as deep. They generally stop accumulating money when they stop working, at which point, they start to take distributions, which ultimately reduce the size of their nest egg. If their investment portfolio does not make a consistent return, they may run out of money. A bull market in one year may not undo the damage the bear market did the year before. What's more, individuals are subject to the inevitable emergencies, illnesses, and bumps in the road that require cash.

> The Teacher's Retirement System of Texas in contrast, took a different path. The fund invested in stocks and lost its bet in the bear market of 2000 to 2002. Fund assets dropped to $79 billion in 2003 from a high of $90 billion in 2000. To make up the 16 billion budget gap, it decided to put its money into hedge funds and other higher yielding asset classes. Unfortunately, it landed on the losing side of a hedge fund disaster. Amaranth Advisers revealed that in September 2006 it had lost roughly 6 billion, or 65 percent of its assets, on misplaced bets in the natural gas market. When a $10 billion hedge fund drops by 65 percent in one month, its investors, which in this case included major pension funds across the United States, are shaken. What new risky investments will have to be made to make up for this and other shortfalls?

With all investments, except safe individual bonds, your chips are on the table until you sell. Either you make two right decisions, when to buy and when to sell, or you are just wrong and you lose. Until you close your position by selling, your money is at risk. Although stocks, real estate, and commodities might have performed well in the past during certain periods, there is no way to know whether they will have significant losses or gains in the future. Holding individual bonds, however, helps you to avoid this problem. With individual bonds, you do not need to make two right decisions—when to buy and when to sell. Bonds require only one decision: the decision to buy and hold until they come due. Your principal plus interest is returned to you without another decision.

### Historial Annual Return

The actual annual historical return on stocks is much less than 10 percent when taxes, transaction costs, and bad timing of the stock market are taken into account.

You cannot measure the actual performance of a stock portfolio or stock fund for individual investors without taking into account the burden of income taxes, transaction costs, investment-management fees, and the possibility of an individual investor's poor timing when he buys and sells stock based on emotion. Because of these real life costs, it is impossible for individual investors to have realized the stock market returns reported by Ibbotson.

A buy-and-hold strategy may not solve the market-timing problem. Buying and holding works well for stocks in a bull market like the one from 1982 to 1999. But a buy-and-hold strategy results in serious losses and creates a great deal of wear and tear on individual investors in a bear market, such as the one from 2000 to 2002. The Nasdaq lost 77.9 percent of its value during the collapse of this market bubble. The success of a buy-and-hold strategy depends on the period in which the stock is held.

Because individual investors have limited life spans, the holding period is of more than theoretical interest. For example, in the years 1965 to 1982, the Dow started out at about 1,000 and ended the period at pretty much the same place. If that happened to be the period during which you were saving for retirement, you would have been out of luck. It would be no help to you that the historical return was 10 percent.

### Taxes, Costs, and Risks of Investing In Bonds

#### Taxes

If you are in the 25 percent tax bracket or higher, the impact of federal and state income taxes is generally large enough to indicate that you should purchase tax-free municipal bonds for your taxable nonpension account. By purchasing municipals, you avoid paying federal income tax and possibly state and local income taxes as well on the interest income. Though the interest rate on municipals is lower than the taxable rates, after taxes you will come out ahead. Tax-free municipal bonds provide the best legal tax shelter available to individual investors.

Many taxpayers are now subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which is pushing more taxpayers into paying higher federal income taxes. Municipal bond interest is not subject to the AMT, except for the interest income from the municipal bonds called AMT bonds. If you are in a lower federal income tax bracket in a high-tax state, consider purchasing Treasuries, home-state taxable munis, and certain agency bonds that are exempt from state and local income taxes, but not from federal income tax.

#### Transaction costs

The cost to purchase a bond is called the "spread," which is the difference between the price that the broker paid for the bond and the higher price at which he sells it to you. In addition to a spread, discount brokers may charge you a fee for service. Discount brokers don't save you money in the world of bonds. However, if you buy a bond on its initial public offering, you will receive an institutional price—the best possible price. If you hold an individual bond until it comes due, there are no further transaction costs.

#### Risk

With highly rated bonds, you have no significant loss of principal to worry about as long as you hold the bonds until they come due at their face value. We believe that in a comparison of stocks and bonds, highly rated bonds should be given a significant premium over stocks because these bonds are safe, dependable, and pay a steady rate of interest that can be counted on.

#### Bad timing

The risk of bad timing is small if you hold your bonds until they come due because every bond comes due at its face value, no matter what the price fluctuations might be before its due date. Keep records of your bond purchases so that they are recorded at face value, rather than adjusting their value every month as valued on your brokerage statement. If you keep your bonds recorded at face value, you will be less likely to sell your bonds before they come due and make a market timing mistake.

### Past Performance

There are two main reasons for the assumption that stocks will outperform bonds in the future: First, it's taken for granted that stocks have always outperformed bonds in the past. Therefore, the assumption is that they will continue to outperform bonds in the future. In fact, stocks have not always outperformed bonds. The leader depends on which span of years you choose to look at. More important, as we'll discuss later in this chapter, the actual annual historical performance of stocks by our calculations is more like 6 percent to 7 percent rather than 10 percent.

But if you believe that stocks will always outperform bonds, why would you invest in bonds at all? If you're open to other eventualities, you'll understand the advantages of bonds and why we believe that bonds and the 100 percent bond portfolio are a better investment strategy for individual investors.

### Risk

In his book *Worry-Free Investing*, Bodie tells readers that conventional wisdom is wrong. Stocks don't always produce the highest return, diversification doesn't always protect you against loss, and the risk of owning stocks does not always decline the longer you hold them. Stocks are risky and will remain risky, no matter how long you own them.



### Growth and Income

Investors who hold the old assumption that bonds provide only income have never heard of zero-coupon bonds. A zero-coupon bond pays no interest currently and sells for a price that is significantly below its face value. For example, in 2006, we purchased a U.S. Agency zero-coupon bond that comes due in twelve years. The bond is also noncallable, which means that the agency can't buy the bond back from the investor before its due date. The unit price for the bond was 50, and it will come due at a price of 100 in twelve years. Therefore, in twelve years these bonds will double in value. There is no question that the bonds will double if held to maturity because a U.S. Agency bond is essentially risk free. Is this doubling in value income or growth? Would you be interested in a guaranteed 100 percent return in twelve years without the possibility of a loss? Zero-coupon bonds show the power of compounding, Einstein's eighth wonder of the world.

Instead of investing in a zero-coupon bond, you might purchase a coupon bond paying current interest and reinvest the interest in additional bonds rather than spending the interest income. In this strategy, you would have the cash flow as well as the growth. Should the gain be considered income or growth?

### A Second Look at Risks and Returns



> The media makes finding undervalued assets seem easy. Volatile markets, whether in stocks, commodities, or real estate, always attract a lot of media attention. Investors want to get rich quick, and the media are happy to tell them how.



Let's take a real-life example. The Nasdaq hit a high of 5,048 on March 10, 2000, before it declined to 1,114 on October 9, 2002, in the bear market. To get back to its all-time high of about 5,048, from 1,114, the Nasdaq would have to appreciate by almost 400 percent. The media, however, were happy to report that the Nasdaq doubled when it went from 1,114 to over 2,000. That sounds great, except that at around the 2,000 level it is still down almost 60 percent from its high of 5,048. If you had invested $100 at the high point, you would have only $40 after the double. If you had invested in bonds, you would still have your $100 and the accumulated interest paid on that investment. We can learn from these examples that recovering from a stock loss is quite difficult, and some investors will ride their winners down and not recover.

In fact, bonds generally increase in value when there is a bear market in stocks, commodities, or real estate because of the so-called flight to quality that generally follows a market collapse.
