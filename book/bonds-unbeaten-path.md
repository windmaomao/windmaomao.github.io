# Bonds - The Unbeaten Path to Secure Investment Growth 

## Introduction

The world has changed drastically in the past twenty years. The economic safety net is now frayed. Job security has sharply declined. Company-sponsored pension plans are becoming extinct, and many people worry about the health of the Social Security and Medicare systems. Given these concerns, we all must take responsibility for our own financial well-being.

Bonds can free investors from any fear of investing. Safe bonds will protect your principal and generate substantial after-tax income without subjecting you to the substantial risk inherent in stocks. We believe that bonds will provide as good or better returns than stocks in the future and without substantial volatility. Bonds will also provide growth through the magic of compound interest if you reinvest the income that bonds provide. *Bonds* offers you a way to realize your financial goals and secure your financial future without taking a market risk.

## Clearing the Cobwebs

### I. Bonds The Better Investment

> "Watching your stocks all day long is amusing up to a point, but income is the thing if you're shopping for anything from pajamas to pastrami sandwiches." - Joe Mysak Bloomberg columnist

The stated historical return of 10 percent on stocks is merely theoretical because it does not take into account taxes, expenses, and investors' bad timing. It is uncertain that stocks will outperform bonds in the future, and the risk of a severe stock market decline increases as the investment period increases. Stocks are riskier and less predictable than bonds.

Individual investors have a different time line and pockets that are not nearly as deep. They generally stop accumulating money when they stop working, at which point, they start to take distributions, which ultimately reduce the size of their nest egg. If their investment portfolio does not make a consistent return, they may run out of money. A bull market in one year may not undo the damage the bear market did the year before. What's more, individuals are subject to the inevitable emergencies, illnesses, and bumps in the road that require cash.

> The Teacher's Retirement System of Texas in contrast, took a different path. The fund invested in stocks and lost its bet in the bear market of 2000 to 2002. Fund assets dropped to $79 billion in 2003 from a high of $90 billion in 2000. To make up the 16 billion budget gap, it decided to put its money into hedge funds and other higher yielding asset classes. Unfortunately, it landed on the losing side of a hedge fund disaster. Amaranth Advisers revealed that in September 2006 it had lost roughly 6 billion, or 65 percent of its assets, on misplaced bets in the natural gas market. When a $10 billion hedge fund drops by 65 percent in one month, its investors, which in this case included major pension funds across the United States, are shaken. What new risky investments will have to be made to make up for this and other shortfalls?

With all investments, except safe individual bonds, your chips are on the table until you sell. Either you make two right decisions, when to buy and when to sell, or you are just wrong and you lose. Until you close your position by selling, your money is at risk. Although stocks, real estate, and commodities might have performed well in the past during certain periods, there is no way to know whether they will have significant losses or gains in the future. Holding individual bonds, however, helps you to avoid this problem. With individual bonds, you do not need to make two right decisions—when to buy and when to sell. Bonds require only one decision: the decision to buy and hold until they come due. Your principal plus interest is returned to you without another decision.

#### Historial Annual Return

The actual annual historical return on stocks is much less than 10 percent when taxes, transaction costs, and bad timing of the stock market are taken into account.

You cannot measure the actual performance of a stock portfolio or stock fund for individual investors without taking into account the burden of income taxes, transaction costs, investment-management fees, and the possibility of an individual investor's poor timing when he buys and sells stock based on emotion. Because of these real life costs, it is impossible for individual investors to have realized the stock market returns reported by Ibbotson.

A buy-and-hold strategy may not solve the market-timing problem. Buying and holding works well for stocks in a bull market like the one from 1982 to 1999. But a buy-and-hold strategy results in serious losses and creates a great deal of wear and tear on individual investors in a bear market, such as the one from 2000 to 2002. The Nasdaq lost 77.9 percent of its value during the collapse of this market bubble. The success of a buy-and-hold strategy depends on the period in which the stock is held.

Because individual investors have limited life spans, the holding period is of more than theoretical interest. For example, in the years 1965 to 1982, the Dow started out at about 1,000 and ended the period at pretty much the same place. If that happened to be the period during which you were saving for retirement, you would have been out of luck. It would be no help to you that the historical return was 10 percent.

#### Taxes, Costs, and Risks of Investing In Bonds

##### Taxes

If you are in the 25 percent tax bracket or higher, the impact of federal and state income taxes is generally large enough to indicate that you should purchase tax-free municipal bonds for your taxable nonpension account. By purchasing municipals, you avoid paying federal income tax and possibly state and local income taxes as well on the interest income. Though the interest rate on municipals is lower than the taxable rates, after taxes you will come out ahead. Tax-free municipal bonds provide the best legal tax shelter available to individual investors.

Many taxpayers are now subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which is pushing more taxpayers into paying higher federal income taxes. Municipal bond interest is not subject to the AMT, except for the interest income from the municipal bonds called AMT bonds. If you are in a lower federal income tax bracket in a high-tax state, consider purchasing Treasuries, home-state taxable munis, and certain agency bonds that are exempt from state and local income taxes, but not from federal income tax.

##### Transaction costs

The cost to purchase a bond is called the "spread," which is the difference between the price that the broker paid for the bond and the higher price at which he sells it to you. In addition to a spread, discount brokers may charge you a fee for service. Discount brokers don't save you money in the world of bonds. However, if you buy a bond on its initial public offering, you will receive an institutional price—the best possible price. If you hold an individual bond until it comes due, there are no further transaction costs.

##### Risk

With highly rated bonds, you have no significant loss of principal to worry about as long as you hold the bonds until they come due at their face value. We believe that in a comparison of stocks and bonds, highly rated bonds should be given a significant premium over stocks because these bonds are safe, dependable, and pay a steady rate of interest that can be counted on.

#### Bad timing

The risk of bad timing is small if you hold your bonds until they come due because every bond comes due at its face value, no matter what the price fluctuations might be before its due date. Keep records of your bond purchases so that they are recorded at face value, rather than adjusting their value every month as valued on your brokerage statement. If you keep your bonds recorded at face value, you will be less likely to sell your bonds before they come due and make a market timing mistake.

#### Past Performance

There are two main reasons for the assumption that stocks will outperform bonds in the future: First, it's taken for granted that stocks have always outperformed bonds in the past. Therefore, the assumption is that they will continue to outperform bonds in the future. In fact, stocks have not always outperformed bonds. The leader depends on which span of years you choose to look at. More important, as we'll discuss later in this chapter, the actual annual historical performance of stocks by our calculations is more like 6 percent to 7 percent rather than 10 percent.

But if you believe that stocks will always outperform bonds, why would you invest in bonds at all? If you're open to other eventualities, you'll understand the advantages of bonds and why we believe that bonds and the 100 percent bond portfolio are a better investment strategy for individual investors.

#### Risk

In his book *Worry-Free Investing*, Bodie tells readers that conventional wisdom is wrong. Stocks don't always produce the highest return, diversification doesn't always protect you against loss, and the risk of owning stocks does not always decline the longer you hold them. Stocks are risky and will remain risky, no matter how long you own them.



#### Growth and Income

Investors who hold the old assumption that bonds provide only income have never heard of zero-coupon bonds. A zero-coupon bond pays no interest currently and sells for a price that is significantly below its face value. For example, in 2006, we purchased a U.S. Agency zero-coupon bond that comes due in twelve years. The bond is also noncallable, which means that the agency can't buy the bond back from the investor before its due date. The unit price for the bond was 50, and it will come due at a price of 100 in twelve years. Therefore, in twelve years these bonds will double in value. There is no question that the bonds will double if held to maturity because a U.S. Agency bond is essentially risk free. Is this doubling in value income or growth? Would you be interested in a guaranteed 100 percent return in twelve years without the possibility of a loss? Zero-coupon bonds show the power of compounding, Einstein's eighth wonder of the world.

Instead of investing in a zero-coupon bond, you might purchase a coupon bond paying current interest and reinvest the interest in additional bonds rather than spending the interest income. In this strategy, you would have the cash flow as well as the growth. Should the gain be considered income or growth?

#### A Second Look at Risks and Returns



> The media makes finding undervalued assets seem easy. Volatile markets, whether in stocks, commodities, or real estate, always attract a lot of media attention. Investors want to get rich quick, and the media are happy to tell them how.



Let's take a real-life example. The Nasdaq hit a high of 5,048 on March 10, 2000, before it declined to 1,114 on October 9, 2002, in the bear market. To get back to its all-time high of about 5,048, from 1,114, the Nasdaq would have to appreciate by almost 400 percent. The media, however, were happy to report that the Nasdaq doubled when it went from 1,114 to over 2,000. That sounds great, except that at around the 2,000 level it is still down almost 60 percent from its high of 5,048. If you had invested $100 at the high point, you would have only $40 after the double. If you had invested in bonds, you would still have your $100 and the accumulated interest paid on that investment. We can learn from these examples that recovering from a stock loss is quite difficult, and some investors will ride their winners down and not recover.

In fact, bonds generally increase in value when there is a bear market in stocks, commodities, or real estate because of the so-called flight to quality that generally follows a market collapse.

### II. The All-Bond Portfolio

>  "When the market goes up, risk tolerance is infinite, but when it goes down, risk tolerance is often at zero." - Harold R. Evensky Chairman, Evensky & Katz

In the name of diversification, these individual investors place a substantial amount of their nest egg in risky investments that they may not understand and ultimately take on more risk than they can actually sustain. Individual forays into risky investments either exhilarate us with their gains or leave us in a puddle of miseries.

It's easy to be misled if one looks only at the historical return of an investment or asset class instead of focusing on the risks involved to realize that return. A higher return means more risk, and more risk means that losses—yes, losses—are more likely. Overlooked tax consequences may severely reduce the expected return of an investment. Up-front, yearly, and back-end fees substantially reduce returns, whether you win or lose.

We believe that individual investors should match their investment assets with their financial needs (for example, retirement and education expenses), rather than speculate in the markets. If safe bonds are the core of your investment assets, you will be able to align your investments with your financial and life goals.

> You need to make only one right decision because bonds repay their face value on their due date. With all other investments, you have to make two right decisions: when to buy and when to sell.

Decreasing expenses and increasing your interest income from bonds is a safe and sound way to achieve a less stressful financial life. It also may enable you to accept a job that you love even though it pays less. The 100 percent bond portfolio is your passport to a richer, more flexible, less stressful life.

Their principal is essentially risk free. For example, a Treasury bond or a U.S. Agency bond will not default. The default rate on municipal bonds is historically less than 1 percent, and those defaults are generally in predictable sectors.

> An old saw on Wall Street goes "**All investors walk the line between greed and fear."** 

### III. A Case Study

Peter terminated his engagement with his financial adviser because despite his portfolio's diversification he found that his investments were volatile, unpredictable, and expensive. But worst of all, he didn't believe that his investments supported his financial or life goals or that he would reach those goals safely.

I told Peter that a key question in financial planning is whether an investor has enough financial resources so that he can withstand the consequences of being wrong. If not, we tell him he should not play. Relying on an optimistic reading of financial history to plan your financial future may end badly. To be safe, place your savings in safe investments like plain-vanilla bonds rather than rely on risky investments to do the heavy lifting.

## Bond Basics

When inflation lights a fire under the yields, driving down the price of your individual bond, that's no reason to despair. Your bonds will pay out their face value at maturity. Meanwhile, you can reinvest your interest at the higher rates, giving you an overall higher yield-to-maturity than you might otherwise have had if rates had not risen. You'll get your invested dollars back and get a higher yield than you had expected. If you reinvest the interest, your assets will grow through the geometric magic of compound interest. You will earn interest on interest as well as interest on your principal with every day that passes.

You earn interest on interest plus interest an your principal, which grows with every day that passes. You have the opportunity for better yields if there's inflation, you're protected from the worst returns in a deflation, and you get your money back. Sounds like a pretty good deal to us.

### The Evolution of a Bond

Based on U.S. case law, a bond, according to *Black's Law Dictionary*, is "a long-term, interest-bearing debt instrument issued by a corporation or governmental entity, usually to provide for a particular financial need; especially, such an instrument in which the debt is secured by a lien on the issuer's property."

During the Dark Ages, merchant activity for all intents and purposes ceased. In addition, Charlemagne became the first ruler to prohibit all usury. If the result of lending was considered usury, the punishment was death. The Catholic Church effectively prevented all above-board acts of lending and borrowing, except as conducted by the Church itself. The Church had liquid capital that it lent to nobles and secured the debt with their land. The loan was called a "land gage." It was a live gage when the land's revenue repaid the debt and a mort gage (mortgage) when it did not.

Today, negotiable loans pay interest. *Black's Law Dictionary* defines interest for money as "the compensation fixed by agreement or allowed by law...especially, the amount owed to a lender in return for the use of borrowed money."

Hamilton's successor, Albert Gallatin, quickly figured out that the scheme was not working: interest on the debt was growing faster than the sinking fund interest that was supposed to pay off the debt. His solution was to reduce the debt by buying bonds in the marketplace if they were selling at or below face value. In so doing, he created the U.S. government's first open market operations. The Federal Reserve periodically engages in such activity today, buying and selling bonds in the open markets to expand or contract credit.

At the time Thompson started his agency, a depression had hit the U.S. economy, and state revenues declined sharply. Payment of interest and principal was postponed, in some cases for as long as seven years, until all debts were repaid. (Principal is the face value of a bond, as opposed to the interest it pays.) Only two states, Mississippi and Florida, repudiated their debt at that time. Lest anyone think that lenders have short memories when they've been stiffed, it's reported that when officials from Mississippi went to London to sell a taxable Eurobond issue in 1987, they were told, to their surprise, that "the state's credit was no good. The state of Mississippi, the bankers explained, still owed London banks principal and interest on $7 million of defaulted state debt—sold 156 years earlier and repudiated in 1857!"

It is important to note that in the present day as well, repudiation of debt is much more likely to occur when the populace does not specifically vote to incur the debt in the first place. Government officials always have visions of projects they wish to fund, some of which are basic improvements and others reflect special interests. Tax-averse citizens try to limit their local government's ability to issue bonds by writing laws placed on the ballot and approved by vote. As we'll explain later, creative financing methods circumvent those restrictions. California is at the forefront of these conflicting interests.

During World War II, interest rates remained low for Treasury bonds, with fixed rates ranging from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for the 25− to 30-year bonds. Despite the low returns, when the highest federal income tax rate hit 94 percent between 1944 and 1945, the tax-exempt appeal of municipal bonds became magnetic. With 1945 came the end of the war and a suspension of long-term Treasury bond issuance for eight years. The so-called long bonds were eagerly bought in 1945 and again in 1999, when the government announced that it was going to pay down the government debt and reduce the supply of these 30-year bonds. Traders expected to see rapid price appreciation as their supply diminished.

### The life of a Bond

However, the idea of a coupon lingers in bond terminology because a bond's interest rate is referred to as its **coupon rate**, or just plain **coupon**. The coupon rate is set as a percentage of the face value when the bond is issued. Thus, a $10,000 10-year bond with a coupon rate of 5 percent will annually pay $500, which is 5 percent of $10,000.

For the buy-and-hold investor, these two basic bond structures provide financial peace of mind because they will either enjoy a steady stream of income until—or receive a lump sum at—the time the face value of the bond is returned to them. This is called **redemption at maturity**. 

Bonds are neither simple nor stodgy. They are, rather, very rewarding. In contrast to stocks, which represent part ownership of a company, bonds are debt—pure but not always simple. Companies, municipalities, states, and the federal government issue bonds for either short-term or long-term funding needs.

#### Preparing a Bond issue

With regard to municipal bonds, an outside consultant frequently works with the municipality's finance director and lawyers to organize, collect, and represent the financial data to prospective buyers of the debt, including the underwriters. Most municipalities come to market infrequently and do not have an in-house staff.

An underwriter is the bank or brokerage house that initially buys the bonds from the issuer and then resells them to investors. Since buying a large block of debt and then reselling it into a constantly shifting market can be financially hazardous, underwriters spread their risk by having similar organizations join in the sale of the bond to investors. The resulting grouping is called an **underwriting syndicate**.

At some point in this process, the issuer decides whether or not the bond will be callable. A **call** is a kind of option that gives an issuer the right, but not the obligation, to redeem a bond issue before its maturity (due date). Many bond issues have a fixed call prior to maturity. Municipal bonds may also have extraordinary calls that certain situations trigger. Bonds are called when it is advantageous to the issuer, leaving the buyer to scratch around to find another bond investment, often at a lower yield. 

In the event of a bankruptcy, not all of an issuer's bondholders are treated equally. Some bonds have senior liens, meaning that they come first in line before other creditors if there is a financial problem. Other bond issues from the same company may have only subordinated or junior lien positions.

When a single issue consists of bonds with different redemption dates, the bonds are called **serial bonds**. These types of bonds give the issuer the flexibility of not having to pay off everything in one lump sum. Many municipal bond issues are commonly offered this way. A term bond is a longer-term bond with a final maturity date. Many corporate and U.S. government bonds are issued this way.

Once the issuer assembles all the necessary information, writers specializing in obscure prose prepare an **offering statement (OS)**, or **prospectus**. As a friend of ours once described it, only half facetiously, "[The offering statement] is written about matters that few understand and for people who will never read it." This document, produced under the issuer's aegis, sums up all the work of the professionals who created the bond and details its type, structure, special features (if any), and the strength and weaknesses of the issuer. It also describes any liabilities that might exist and the participants in the deal. If you take time to peruse it, you will learn a great deal.

#### Rating a Bond

Rating agency analysts are best known because their ratings are widely publicized and provide a recognized guide to bond purchasers. With this recognition, these analysts have become powerful players in the bond markets because their ratings strongly influence how much an issuer will have to pay to borrow money. 

Market sentiment always precedes any downgrade. Thus, ratings are broadly viewed as lagging indicators, especially in the high-yield market.

#### Launching a Bond

At its first appearance, a bond is said to be in the primary, or new, bond market. Within the primary market, Treasury bonds are sold by auction at announced times. Some large corporate bond issuers have so-called shelf registrations and allow brokers to sell bonds over time. In this case, the offering rate adjusts with the fluctuation of interest rates. Other corporate issuers, federal agencies, or municipal issuers arrange for the sale of their bonds all at once.

> "Where money goes the quickest, the risk goes even faster." - Bob Farrell, a  retired chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch.

#### A Bond's Cost and Yield

##### Determinning a Bond's Yield

The concept of yield creates the equilibrium between bonds sold at different prices. This concept is so important that we highlight it here: *Bonds are bought and sold based on yield, not on price*. This represents a key distinction between these financial instruments and stocks, which are always bought and sold in terms of price. **Yield** is the general term for the percentage return on a security investment. It is often called the **rate of return**. In bond language, it is very different from the stated coupon rate. 

##### Current Yield

When you purchase bond mutual funds, which pay dividends, you are quoted a current yield because these securities have no maturity. The dividends from bond mutual funds are a combination of bond interest and capital gains from bond sales. Therefore, they are not directly comparable to compounding bond yields, which are quoted as a yield-to-maturity or yield-to-call.

By comparison, bonds must pay scheduled interest payments, or they are in default.

##### Simple and Compound Interest

> Compound interest is called the eighth wonder of the world. It can work *for* you by creating wealth when you buy bonds, or it can work *against* you when you pay interest on your debts. It has great impartial power.

**The rule of 72**. The Rule of 72 tells you approximately how many years it takes money to double when it compounds at a particular rate of annual interest. For example, if the rate of return is 10 percent, you divide 72 by 10 and learn that it takes approximately 7.2 years for the money to double at a 10 percent compounded rate. Similarly, if the rate of return were 5 percent, it would take 14.4 years to double your money (72 ÷ 5 = 14.4 years).

##### Yield-to-Maturity

Yield-to-maturity (YTM) is the benchmark against which individual bonds are traded and quoted. YTM and the following two yield calculations all use the concept of compound interest. In the bond world, calculations assume that money never lies fallow or hidden away in a mattress. Rather, it is constantly reinvested to generate further income. Although YTM is not a perfect calculation, it is widely used because it is the unifying standard for all bond pricing.

YTM makes the following assumptions: (1) You retain ownership for the remaining life of the bond and (2) all interest payments are reinvested at the same prevailing rate (YTM). However, since interest rates change over time, your actual return on a bond does, too, unless you own a zero-coupon bond. If rates rise, for example, and you are able to reinvest the semiannual interest payments at a better rate, your actual return will be higher than quoted. If interest rates decline over the life of the bond, and you reinvest the interest at a lower rate, your actual return will be lower. Note that the key concept underpinning all this is compound interest. The YTM calculation assumes reinvestment of every interest payment, whether monthly or semiannually, at the YTM rate.

##### Duration

In general, the lower the current interest payment or coupon of the bond, the longer the duration; the higher the coupon, the shorter the duration. The duration of a zero-coupon bond is the same as its maturity. Thus, the price of zero-coupon bonds changes the most with a change in interest rates.

Let's consider a simplified example. Assume that a bond has a duration of four years, and you sell it soon after its purchase. In this case, if interest rates go up by 1 percent, the price of the bond will go down by approximately 4 percent. Similarly, if interest rates go down by 1 percent, the price of the bond will go up by approximately 4 percent.

#### Cash Flow upon Death: The estate feature

To ease concern about selling bonds in the secondary market, some issuers add a put feature to their bonds to make them more attractive to individual buyers. In the event of death of the bond-holder, the estate can receive the face value of the bonds even if the bond is selling at a discount. The advantage of this feature is that you can purchase longer-dated bonds without concern for the market value of the bonds beyond the natural life of the holder. Theoretically, your bonds would become liquid upon your death.

##### Pricing a Secondary Market Bond

When you purchase secondary market bonds, the bond may have been outstanding for some time. The bond may have little or no call protection. In this situation, the yield at the par call determines your purchase price.

The yields on Treasury bonds are benchmarks for all bonds, although as noted above, they are particularly useful for corporate and agency securities. 

The scale for muni bonds is different from the scale for corporate bonds or Treasury bonds. Each is a separate though related market. Municipal bond prices are not adjusted as quickly as Treasuries, although they also move in relation to Treasuries. This difference exists because muni bonds serve a different market, namely, buyers interested in a tax-exempt product. Demand and supply differences skew the prices.

## Bond Categories

### U.S. Treasury Securities

In 2000 and 2001, when the government was running budget surpluses, many of these older bonds were called and, thus, retired from public circulation. Owners of 30-year Treasuries that were bought in 1976 with an annual 14 percent interest rate were not happy in 2001 when they were told by the government that the party was over and that they had to part with those bonds at a time when other Treasuries were yielding about 4.5 percent.

All Treasuries are issued with a minimum face value of $1,000 and in increments of $1,000 above that. You can purchase them at auction by using the TreasuryDirect system. TreasuryDirect is a book-entry securities system, operated by the U.S. Bureau of the Public Debt, which allows you to maintain accounts directly with the U.S. Treasury. Alternatively, you can purchase all Treasury securities from a bank or a brokerage firm, either in the open market or at a Treasury auction. You can transfer most types of Treasury securities you buy from your bank or broker to your TreasuryDirect account. Upon your instructions, TreasuryDirect will get three bids for you if you want to sell in the secondary market any Treasury securities you hold in your TreasuryDirect account.

There are two principal advantages of using TreasuryDirect. First, you pay no fee and no spread (the difference between the broker's buy and sell prices) to purchase Treasuries. Second, the custodian of your Treasury securities is the federal government. Thus, the possible risks associated with a failed brokerage firm holding your securities do not exist. The two principal disadvantages of using TreasuryDirect are that you can purchase Treasury securities only at the time of an auction and that Treasury-Direct will not make a margin loan.

#### U.S. Treasury Notes and Bonds

Treasury notes and bonds both pay interest every six months and are initially sold at auction. Although both Treasury notes and bonds are issued to finance the longer-term needs of the U.S. government, they are distinguished by the terms of their maturities. The maturity of Treasury notes is set at a minimum of one year and does not exceed ten years. The government currently issues notes in 2-, 5-, and 10-year maturities. Auctions for the 2-year and 5-year notes are held monthly. The auction for the 10-year notes are held quarterly, and auctions for the 30-year bond are held quarterly beginning in 2007.

Interest income from Treasury notes and bonds is subject to federal income tax but not to state and local taxes. The interest paid at six-month intervals is taxable in the year received. In addition, if a Treasury bond is purchased for less than its face amount, in certain cases, the difference between the amount paid and its face value may be taxable as interest income over the period between the date of acquisition and the earlier of the maturity date or the date you sell the bond. If you pay more than the face amount for the bond, you may be entitled to deduct the difference between the amount paid and the face amount over the same period.

#### U.S. Treasury Bills

Treasury bills, popularly known as T-bills, are used to finance the short-term needs of the U.S. government. The 4-week bills, 13-week bills, and 26-week bills are each offered weekly and are available in commercial markets.

T-bills also differ from Treasury notes and bonds in that they do not pay interest every six months. Rather, they are sold at a discount to their face value. The difference between the discounted price you pay and the face value you receive at maturity is treated as interest income, rather than as a capital gain. Thus, T-bills pay interest only at maturity. In addition, although T-bills can be sold at any time without a penalty, you might realize a gain or a loss on the sale.

Unlike Treasury notes and bonds, you can use T-bill purchases as a short-term tax planning strategy. This is done by taking advantage of the fact that you report interest income from T-bills only in the year in which the bill comes due. To move interest income from one year to the next, buy a T-bill that has a maturity date in the next year. For example, if you bought a 26-week bill on August 1, 2006, you would report your interest income as having been received on February 1, 2007. That interest income would not be subject to tax in your 2006 federal income tax return but would be subject to tax in your 2007 return.



#### STRIPS

STRIPS is the popularly used acronym for the U.S. Treasury's Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities Program. In many ways, the approach is similar to that of T-bills in that STRIPS are zero-coupon securities sold at a discount to their face value, with interest payments made only at maturity. As with T-bills, the difference between the purchase price of STRIPS and their face value provides the return.

>  STRIPS are useful for investors who want to receive a known payment on a specific future date.

Another advantage is that the total return on STRIPS is known precisely at the date of purchase if you hold the STRIPS to their due date. In interest-paying bonds, such as Treasury bonds, the total return depends in part on the rate at which you reinvest your interest payments every six months. In addition, you can buy STRIPS to come due in any year that would be desirable for your retirement or college education program.

Even though interest from STRIPS is exempt from state and local taxes, you should consider the advantages of holding these bonds in a tax-sheltered retirement account, such as an IRA, as opposed to a taxable account. Interest on STRIPS held in a tax-sheltered retirement account is not subject to federal income tax until there is a distribution of cash from the account. However, if you hold the STRIPS outside of a tax-sheltered retirement account, you must report interest on STRIPS annually on your federal income tax return as ordinary interest income, even though you receive no cash until you redeem or sell the STRIPS. 

#### TIPS

Treasury notes and bonds pay out a fixed amount of cash, based on the coupon rate, every six months. In contrast, every six months, TIPS pay out a variable amount of cash that is initially lower than the amount paid by Treasury notes and bonds. As described next, this generally more modest coupon is designed to allow for the substantial principal accrual that is supposed to match the variability of the future cost of living. In this way, TIPS are designed to provide a guaranteed return over and above the inflation rate. Although the value of the principal varies over time, all TIPS are initially sold at auction in minimum amounts of $1,000.

TIPS provide a way to diversify your portfolio, as well as three levels of protection. First, interest payments rise with inflation. Second, the principal amount increases with inflation. Third, the Treasury guarantees that when the bond comes due, the minimum price that you will receive is the face value of the bond. Thus, the risk of a severe deflation reducing the value of the bond below its face value is eliminated. As a result, TIPS should be less volatile than other bonds with the same maturity. All primary dealers trade TIPS, though not as much as they trade other Treasuries.

### U.S. Savings Bonds

Because of these complexities, we describe the best way to capitalize on the advantages of the EE and I savings bonds under each individual description. Despite their complexity, savings bonds may be great investments. There are no fees, loads, or commissions to buy them. They are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government, will not decline in value over the years, and are not callable. They are free of state and local income tax and may be free of federal income tax if used for certain educational expenses by qualified taxpayers.

EE bonds have numerous attractions. Most important, they provide protection against inflation and deflation, plus a guaranteed lump-sum distribution at any time after you hold them for twelve months. EE bonds will never decline in value. At a minimum, the U.S. Treasury guarantees that after twenty years, an EE bond will at least double in value. If an EE bond does not double in value as the result of applying the fixed rate for twenty years, the U.S. Treasury will make a one-time adjustment at original maturity to make up the difference. EE bonds earn interest for thirty years. EE bonds purchased before June 2003 are guaranteed to double in less than twenty years. What's more, an EE bond initial investment is as low as $25, rather than $1,000 for a Treasury security. As discussed later, these bonds can provide several tax advantages, particularly with regard to higher-education expenses.

The Education Savings Bond Program, which applies to both EE bonds and I bonds, offers significant tax advantages to qualifying individuals. The Treasury Department introduced this program in 1990 as a response to the soaring costs of higher education.

### U.S. Agency Debt

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are GSEs regulated by the federal government. Fannie Mae was chartered in 1938, and Freddie Mac was chartered in 1970. Both of these GSEs assist low- and moderate-income families in buying homes by providing support and liquidity to the U.S. mortgage market. They do that by borrowing in the capital market (by selling bonds discussed in this chapter) and using the funds raised to purchase mortgages, mortgage securities, and other home loans from banks and other lenders. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are two of the largest issuers of bonds in the United States.

The Fannie Mae global notes and benchmark notes generally sell at a yield that is 20 to 25 basis points (one-fifth to one-quarter of 1 percent) above similar Treasury bonds for 2-year bonds, 25 to 30 basis points for 5-year bonds, and 30 to 35 basis points for 10-year bonds. These spreads can widen or tighten depending on market conditions.

You can avoid this risk by not buying long-term agency bonds with short calls. However, you might buy shorter maturity issues with longer call protection. For example, you might buy 5-year agency bonds with two-year call protection.

Although early call features are a risk, agency bonds of five years or less can also present an opportunity, especially in an atmosphere of rising interest rates. If agency bonds with short calls have a higher yield, consider buying them.

### U.S. Agency and Other Mortgage-Backed Securities

The government stepped in and created the Federal National Mortgage Association as part of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) on February 10, 1938, charging the association with bolstering the housing industry by expanding the flow of mortgage money. Throughout its first years of operation, the Federal National Mortgage Association primarily bought mortgages issued to lower-income people; banks held on to the lucrative returns from mortgages issued to more prosperous customers. 

The A Class security is similar to a short-term bond. Since the A Class receives a share of the interest and all the prepayments initially, it will turn out to be a shorter-term security and will have a more predictable return than the B Class or the Z Class securities. It might be possible to predict with a high degree of reliability that the A Class will retire in, say, three years. The life of and thus the return on the B Class will be more difficult to predict than the A Class, and, thus, the B Class should earn a higher return.

The Z Class nonagency CMO is generally the riskiest and should not be approached unless you or your financial adviser can do a careful analysis of the risks. Any Z Class security may be hard to analyze. Called "toxic waste" in the trade, the Z Class will also be more volatile than other mortgage securities, particularly when interest rates are moving rapidly. The Z Class has poor liquidity. Finally, the Z Class may have accounting and tax aspects that are difficult to understand.

### Municipal Bonds

**Issuers**. A key feature to understand about munis is that they are issued by states, local governments, or special public entities, such as school districts and sewer authorities. In large part, the creditworthiness and revenue sources of these various issuers determine the financial attractiveness of their bonds.

**Taxes**. Tax free is a relative term when applied to munis. Although most munis are exempt from federal income taxes, some are taxable and some are subject to the alternative minimum tax. Many munis find it impossible to escape the clutches of state or city tax departments.

## Options for Purchasing Bonds

> Basically, you have two choices: you can purchase individual bonds or buy them packaged together as funds.

### How to Buy Individual Bonds

THE MOST COMPELLING reason to buy individual bonds is that **bonds come due at a defined time**. Unlike bond mutual funds of any kind, individual bonds pay their face value in cash at maturity. This distinguishing characteristic is a key ingredient in many aspects of financial planning. Need a large chunk of cash for a tuition payment on December 15 ten years from now? Buy a bond that matures on December 1, 2017. Planning to retire? Buy a continuing series of bonds that come due when needed. The list is almost endless.

You can tell how any market is doing by watching the spreads. Are they widening or shrinking? Although there is much greater yield in junk than in higher-rated bonds, the downside risk of losing your principal is also much greater. If your broker tells you that the spread between the plain-vanilla bond and the junk bond is historically low, you know that you're not being paid much for the higher risk. If the spreads are really wide, then you know the market believes the bonds are very risky right now. When the market speaks, listen! Then decide how to act.

### Bond Funds The Good, The Bad, and the Worst

LET'S FACE IT. The easiest way to invest in bonds is to buy a bond mutual fund. Financial firms have catered to this strategy by creating almost 3,000 such funds and packaging them in a variety of shapes, structures, and contents. But holding an individual bond differs greatly from owning a bond fund because the fund has no due date. "**A bond mutual fund is not by definition a fixed-income product**," says Cort Smith, senior editor of *Investment Adviser*.

#### Common Ground

What remains unchanged is that trying to classify and categorize bond funds is a daunting task. Let's first review the characteristics common to all funds. No matter what the size or purpose, every bond fund has a per-share net asset value (NAV). This is the measure by which funds are valued daily. It is calculated by dividing the sum of the values, reduced by any liabilities, of all the bonds in a portfolio by the number of shares outstanding. All funds also provide a figure known as total return. This consists of a fund's cash distributions, plus or minus any change in share price during a specified period.

The NAV drops after a fund pays out the required 90 percent or more of its realized capital gains and dividends, usually in December, to reflect the lower fund value. You pay taxes on the distribution whether you owned the fund one day or one year. Before you invest, it's a good idea to find out when the fund generally makes this distribution.

Since funds are pass-through entities for tax purposes, if you hold shares of a taxable bond fund outside of a retirement account, you must report your share of the fund's interest income minus the fund's expenses. In addition, if the fund has realized capital gains, you must report your share of capital gains annually, whether the fund pays it out to you or reinvests it. If the fund has losses, they will offset the gains recognized by the fund. However, for tax purposes, if a fund has net capital losses, these capital losses may not pass through to its shareholders.

> Because there is no fixed maturity date for bond funds, they are missing the key characteristic that distinguishes an individual bond. Bonds come due, bond funds do not, although the bonds within the fund do come due. If you purchase a bond maturing in three years, you know you will get the face value of the bond back in three years. If you purchase a short-term bond fund, you don't know what your shares will be worth in three years. They may be worth more or they may be worth less.

#### Advantages

**Income**. Regular monthly income with interest and principal payments made as dividend distributions. Individual bonds usually offer semiannual payments, though some pay monthly.

**Reinvestment**. Automatic reinvestment of income. Be aware, however, that this advantage is reduced if the fund charges a fee for the reinvestment.

**Diversification**. Should one bond in a fund default, the others will supposedly smooth out any disaster ripples.

**Daily liquidity**. A simple phone call translates into a sale posted at day's end; some funds offer free check writing on the accounts.

#### Disadvantages

**Lack of fixed maturity date**. An individual bond always provides a due date on which you will receive all your money back, but a bond fund almost never does; in other words, bonds come due, bond funds don't.

**Lack of income guarantee**. With an individual bond, the payment schedule is fixed, whereas payments from the various bonds in a fund can vary.

**Capital gains tax**. You have to pay tax on capital gains realized by the fund. Funds generate capital gains when they sell bonds to raise cash for redemptions or trade securities. Funds that have a high turnover rate, a measure of annual portfolio change, are said to be tax inefficient when they generate capital gains, because the gains are passed through to the shareholders. **Funds can't pass through tax losses.**

**Susceptibility to market risk**. Even conservative Treasury bond funds are subject to market risk. For example, *BusinessWeek* warns: "If the yield on a 10-year Treasury jumps by half a percentage point from 5 percent now, it will lose about 10 percent of its market value." That means that even the bond fund holding the safest securities could still experience a market decline that may continue for many years.

#### Checking the Costs

The largest and most blatant cost is referred to as the load. In effect, this is the sales commission earned by the person who sells you the fund. Funds that have such sales commissions are known as load funds. With these funds, you generally lose money right from the start because the load is deducted from the amount of money you initially invest. Critical comments about front-end loads, as they're called, have led fund companies sometimes to allocate the loads over a number of years or to tack them on at the end.

Other costs, decidedly camouflaged, include back-end loads (yup—some funds charge you to get out of them); annual management fees to cover administrative expenses; advertising fees on the no-load and load funds (they're officially designated as 12b-1 fees); plus all the transaction fees that the fund pays when it buys and sells the bonds in its portfolio. And there are more: some funds have loads on reinvested dividends, exchange fees if you want to transfer from one fund to another, frequent transaction charges, and shareholder accounting costs.

If you are a do-it-yourself investor and looking to keep your costs down, you may purchase no-load funds. Fund families like Vanguard and Fidelity have no-load funds and even lower-cost funds if you have substantial assets to invest. Some funds have instituted retirement shares for 401(k)s and IRAs, which over the long term may have the highest fees of all and are designated by a different letter. Other fund families skip the alphabet soup and have specially designated funds for high-net-worth individuals that have the lowest cost. For example, Vanguard has Admiral Funds, T. Rowe Price has Summit Funds, and Fidelity has Spartan Funds for substantial depositors.

We're biased in favor of funds with the lowest costs. We were, therefore, quite pleased to read about work undertaken by Morningstar, the fund tracking and rating company. As reported in November 2001, funds with the lowest fees performed the best overall: "In areas ranging from ultrashort bond funds to the multisector and intermediate-term bond categories, we found that the lowest-cost quartile of funds posted total returns over the year through October 31 that were better than those of the high-expense offerings."

What's more, Morningstar found that the **higher-cost funds took on added risk** in order to boost the yield and compensate for the added fund costs. The article concludes by pointing out, "If you pay less, you're likely to get better returns and lower risk. That's not a bad combination."

### Bonds Funds A Taxing Matter

#### Tax-Exempt Funds

Between October 2005 and October 2006, municipal bond funds returned 4.22 percent compared to taxable bond funds, which returned 4.16 percent, according to Morning-star.Furthermore, Peter J. DeGroot, vice president and head of municipal strategies at Lehman Brothers, reported that in August 2006 the tax-adjusted returns on municipal bonds for those in the highest tax bracket were 9.63 percent during the previous ten years, compared to 6.88 percent for taxable bonds.Past performance is no predictor of future returns, but if we can reduce expenses, we have a better chance of coming out ahead.

Check out the yields on the state-specific funds compared to the national funds to see if you can avoid paying state taxes as well, while helping to support the state economy by being a lender. Although you may think you should buy a fund with the name of your state on it, there are times when a national muni fund would be more advantageous. Funds may purchase bonds subject to the AMT in order to boost yields. If you're subject to this tax, you might want to check into the fund's policy and review its portfolio before you buy. You might earn more, on an after-tax basis, in a fund that holds no AMT bonds than you would in a fund that holds only bonds of your state of residence.

##### High Yield (Junk Bonds)

the credit quality of municipal bonds varies tremendously. Bonds at the lower end of the spectrum are forced to offer a higher yield to attract investors. Some financial institutions buy these up and package them as high-yield municipal bond funds. These funds suffered great setbacks in 1999 and 2000 as a result of the credit crunch following the bankruptcy of Orange County, California. Investors in a Heartland Advisers fund, for example, saw the fund's value decline by more than 70 percent in one day. These losses were the result of illiquidity in the high-yield market, which limited the ability of the pricing services to adequately value the bonds. The fund manager decided to retain higher values than were justified. Heartland management repriced the funds when they learned about the problem.

In short, high-yield municipal bond funds are every bit as risky as corporate high-yield bond funds. Buyers of these funds must be ever vigilant. The funds are available as open-end mutual funds and as closed-end funds.
