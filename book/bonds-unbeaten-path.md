# Bonds - The Unbeaten Path to Secure Investment Growth 

## Introduction

The world has changed drastically in the past twenty years. The economic safety net is now frayed. Job security has sharply declined. Company-sponsored pension plans are becoming extinct, and many people worry about the health of the Social Security and Medicare systems. Given these concerns, we all must take responsibility for our own financial well-being.

Bonds can free investors from any fear of investing. Safe bonds will protect your principal and generate substantial after-tax income without subjecting you to the substantial risk inherent in stocks. We believe that bonds will provide as good or better returns than stocks in the future and without substantial volatility. Bonds will also provide growth through the magic of compound interest if you reinvest the income that bonds provide. *Bonds* offers you a way to realize your financial goals and secure your financial future without taking a market risk.

## Clearing the Cobwebs

### I. Bonds The Better Investment

> "Watching your stocks all day long is amusing up to a point, but income is the thing if you're shopping for anything from pajamas to pastrami sandwiches." - Joe Mysak Bloomberg columnist

The stated historical return of 10 percent on stocks is merely theoretical because it does not take into account taxes, expenses, and investors' bad timing. It is uncertain that stocks will outperform bonds in the future, and the risk of a severe stock market decline increases as the investment period increases. Stocks are riskier and less predictable than bonds.

Individual investors have a different time line and pockets that are not nearly as deep. They generally stop accumulating money when they stop working, at which point, they start to take distributions, which ultimately reduce the size of their nest egg. If their investment portfolio does not make a consistent return, they may run out of money. A bull market in one year may not undo the damage the bear market did the year before. What's more, individuals are subject to the inevitable emergencies, illnesses, and bumps in the road that require cash.

> The Teacher's Retirement System of Texas in contrast, took a different path. The fund invested in stocks and lost its bet in the bear market of 2000 to 2002. Fund assets dropped to $79 billion in 2003 from a high of $90 billion in 2000. To make up the 16 billion budget gap, it decided to put its money into hedge funds and other higher yielding asset classes. Unfortunately, it landed on the losing side of a hedge fund disaster. Amaranth Advisers revealed that in September 2006 it had lost roughly 6 billion, or 65 percent of its assets, on misplaced bets in the natural gas market. When a $10 billion hedge fund drops by 65 percent in one month, its investors, which in this case included major pension funds across the United States, are shaken. What new risky investments will have to be made to make up for this and other shortfalls?

With all investments, except safe individual bonds, your chips are on the table until you sell. Either you make two right decisions, when to buy and when to sell, or you are just wrong and you lose. Until you close your position by selling, your money is at risk. Although stocks, real estate, and commodities might have performed well in the past during certain periods, there is no way to know whether they will have significant losses or gains in the future. Holding individual bonds, however, helps you to avoid this problem. With individual bonds, you do not need to make two right decisions—when to buy and when to sell. Bonds require only one decision: the decision to buy and hold until they come due. Your principal plus interest is returned to you without another decision.

#### Historial Annual Return

The actual annual historical return on stocks is much less than 10 percent when taxes, transaction costs, and bad timing of the stock market are taken into account.

You cannot measure the actual performance of a stock portfolio or stock fund for individual investors without taking into account the burden of income taxes, transaction costs, investment-management fees, and the possibility of an individual investor's poor timing when he buys and sells stock based on emotion. Because of these real life costs, it is impossible for individual investors to have realized the stock market returns reported by Ibbotson.

A buy-and-hold strategy may not solve the market-timing problem. Buying and holding works well for stocks in a bull market like the one from 1982 to 1999. But a buy-and-hold strategy results in serious losses and creates a great deal of wear and tear on individual investors in a bear market, such as the one from 2000 to 2002. The Nasdaq lost 77.9 percent of its value during the collapse of this market bubble. The success of a buy-and-hold strategy depends on the period in which the stock is held.

Because individual investors have limited life spans, the holding period is of more than theoretical interest. For example, in the years 1965 to 1982, the Dow started out at about 1,000 and ended the period at pretty much the same place. If that happened to be the period during which you were saving for retirement, you would have been out of luck. It would be no help to you that the historical return was 10 percent.

#### Taxes, Costs, and Risks of Investing In Bonds

##### Taxes

If you are in the 25 percent tax bracket or higher, the impact of federal and state income taxes is generally large enough to indicate that you should purchase tax-free municipal bonds for your taxable nonpension account. By purchasing municipals, you avoid paying federal income tax and possibly state and local income taxes as well on the interest income. Though the interest rate on municipals is lower than the taxable rates, after taxes you will come out ahead. Tax-free municipal bonds provide the best legal tax shelter available to individual investors.

Many taxpayers are now subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which is pushing more taxpayers into paying higher federal income taxes. Municipal bond interest is not subject to the AMT, except for the interest income from the municipal bonds called AMT bonds. If you are in a lower federal income tax bracket in a high-tax state, consider purchasing Treasuries, home-state taxable munis, and certain agency bonds that are exempt from state and local income taxes, but not from federal income tax.

##### Transaction costs

The cost to purchase a bond is called the "spread," which is the difference between the price that the broker paid for the bond and the higher price at which he sells it to you. In addition to a spread, discount brokers may charge you a fee for service. Discount brokers don't save you money in the world of bonds. However, if you buy a bond on its initial public offering, you will receive an institutional price—the best possible price. If you hold an individual bond until it comes due, there are no further transaction costs.

##### Risk

With highly rated bonds, you have no significant loss of principal to worry about as long as you hold the bonds until they come due at their face value. We believe that in a comparison of stocks and bonds, highly rated bonds should be given a significant premium over stocks because these bonds are safe, dependable, and pay a steady rate of interest that can be counted on.

#### Bad timing

The risk of bad timing is small if you hold your bonds until they come due because every bond comes due at its face value, no matter what the price fluctuations might be before its due date. Keep records of your bond purchases so that they are recorded at face value, rather than adjusting their value every month as valued on your brokerage statement. If you keep your bonds recorded at face value, you will be less likely to sell your bonds before they come due and make a market timing mistake.

#### Past Performance

There are two main reasons for the assumption that stocks will outperform bonds in the future: First, it's taken for granted that stocks have always outperformed bonds in the past. Therefore, the assumption is that they will continue to outperform bonds in the future. In fact, stocks have not always outperformed bonds. The leader depends on which span of years you choose to look at. More important, as we'll discuss later in this chapter, the actual annual historical performance of stocks by our calculations is more like 6 percent to 7 percent rather than 10 percent.

But if you believe that stocks will always outperform bonds, why would you invest in bonds at all? If you're open to other eventualities, you'll understand the advantages of bonds and why we believe that bonds and the 100 percent bond portfolio are a better investment strategy for individual investors.

#### Risk

In his book *Worry-Free Investing*, Bodie tells readers that conventional wisdom is wrong. Stocks don't always produce the highest return, diversification doesn't always protect you against loss, and the risk of owning stocks does not always decline the longer you hold them. Stocks are risky and will remain risky, no matter how long you own them.



#### Growth and Income

Investors who hold the old assumption that bonds provide only income have never heard of zero-coupon bonds. A zero-coupon bond pays no interest currently and sells for a price that is significantly below its face value. For example, in 2006, we purchased a U.S. Agency zero-coupon bond that comes due in twelve years. The bond is also noncallable, which means that the agency can't buy the bond back from the investor before its due date. The unit price for the bond was 50, and it will come due at a price of 100 in twelve years. Therefore, in twelve years these bonds will double in value. There is no question that the bonds will double if held to maturity because a U.S. Agency bond is essentially risk free. Is this doubling in value income or growth? Would you be interested in a guaranteed 100 percent return in twelve years without the possibility of a loss? Zero-coupon bonds show the power of compounding, Einstein's eighth wonder of the world.

Instead of investing in a zero-coupon bond, you might purchase a coupon bond paying current interest and reinvest the interest in additional bonds rather than spending the interest income. In this strategy, you would have the cash flow as well as the growth. Should the gain be considered income or growth?

#### A Second Look at Risks and Returns



> The media makes finding undervalued assets seem easy. Volatile markets, whether in stocks, commodities, or real estate, always attract a lot of media attention. Investors want to get rich quick, and the media are happy to tell them how.



Let's take a real-life example. The Nasdaq hit a high of 5,048 on March 10, 2000, before it declined to 1,114 on October 9, 2002, in the bear market. To get back to its all-time high of about 5,048, from 1,114, the Nasdaq would have to appreciate by almost 400 percent. The media, however, were happy to report that the Nasdaq doubled when it went from 1,114 to over 2,000. That sounds great, except that at around the 2,000 level it is still down almost 60 percent from its high of 5,048. If you had invested $100 at the high point, you would have only $40 after the double. If you had invested in bonds, you would still have your $100 and the accumulated interest paid on that investment. We can learn from these examples that recovering from a stock loss is quite difficult, and some investors will ride their winners down and not recover.

In fact, bonds generally increase in value when there is a bear market in stocks, commodities, or real estate because of the so-called flight to quality that generally follows a market collapse.

### II. The All-Bond Portfolio

>  "When the market goes up, risk tolerance is infinite, but when it goes down, risk tolerance is often at zero." - Harold R. Evensky Chairman, Evensky & Katz

In the name of diversification, these individual investors place a substantial amount of their nest egg in risky investments that they may not understand and ultimately take on more risk than they can actually sustain. Individual forays into risky investments either exhilarate us with their gains or leave us in a puddle of miseries.

It's easy to be misled if one looks only at the historical return of an investment or asset class instead of focusing on the risks involved to realize that return. A higher return means more risk, and more risk means that losses—yes, losses—are more likely. Overlooked tax consequences may severely reduce the expected return of an investment. Up-front, yearly, and back-end fees substantially reduce returns, whether you win or lose.

We believe that individual investors should match their investment assets with their financial needs (for example, retirement and education expenses), rather than speculate in the markets. If safe bonds are the core of your investment assets, you will be able to align your investments with your financial and life goals.

> You need to make only one right decision because bonds repay their face value on their due date. With all other investments, you have to make two right decisions: when to buy and when to sell.

Decreasing expenses and increasing your interest income from bonds is a safe and sound way to achieve a less stressful financial life. It also may enable you to accept a job that you love even though it pays less. The 100 percent bond portfolio is your passport to a richer, more flexible, less stressful life.

Their principal is essentially risk free. For example, a Treasury bond or a U.S. Agency bond will not default. The default rate on municipal bonds is historically less than 1 percent, and those defaults are generally in predictable sectors.

> An old saw on Wall Street goes "**All investors walk the line between greed and fear."** 

### III. A Case Study

Peter terminated his engagement with his financial adviser because despite his portfolio's diversification he found that his investments were volatile, unpredictable, and expensive. But worst of all, he didn't believe that his investments supported his financial or life goals or that he would reach those goals safely.

I told Peter that a key question in financial planning is whether an investor has enough financial resources so that he can withstand the consequences of being wrong. If not, we tell him he should not play. Relying on an optimistic reading of financial history to plan your financial future may end badly. To be safe, place your savings in safe investments like plain-vanilla bonds rather than rely on risky investments to do the heavy lifting.

## Bond Basics

When inflation lights a fire under the yields, driving down the price of your individual bond, that's no reason to despair. Your bonds will pay out their face value at maturity. Meanwhile, you can reinvest your interest at the higher rates, giving you an overall higher yield-to-maturity than you might otherwise have had if rates had not risen. You'll get your invested dollars back and get a higher yield than you had expected. If you reinvest the interest, your assets will grow through the geometric magic of compound interest. You will earn interest on interest as well as interest on your principal with every day that passes.

You earn interest on interest plus interest an your principal, which grows with every day that passes. You have the opportunity for better yields if there's inflation, you're protected from the worst returns in a deflation, and you get your money back. Sounds like a pretty good deal to us.

### The Evolution of a Bond

Based on U.S. case law, a bond, according to *Black's Law Dictionary*, is "a long-term, interest-bearing debt instrument issued by a corporation or governmental entity, usually to provide for a particular financial need; especially, such an instrument in which the debt is secured by a lien on the issuer's property."

During the Dark Ages, merchant activity for all intents and purposes ceased. In addition, Charlemagne became the first ruler to prohibit all usury. If the result of lending was considered usury, the punishment was death. The Catholic Church effectively prevented all above-board acts of lending and borrowing, except as conducted by the Church itself. The Church had liquid capital that it lent to nobles and secured the debt with their land. The loan was called a "land gage." It was a live gage when the land's revenue repaid the debt and a mort gage (mortgage) when it did not.

Today, negotiable loans pay interest. *Black's Law Dictionary* defines interest for money as "the compensation fixed by agreement or allowed by law...especially, the amount owed to a lender in return for the use of borrowed money."

Hamilton's successor, Albert Gallatin, quickly figured out that the scheme was not working: interest on the debt was growing faster than the sinking fund interest that was supposed to pay off the debt. His solution was to reduce the debt by buying bonds in the marketplace if they were selling at or below face value. In so doing, he created the U.S. government's first open market operations. The Federal Reserve periodically engages in such activity today, buying and selling bonds in the open markets to expand or contract credit.

At the time Thompson started his agency, a depression had hit the U.S. economy, and state revenues declined sharply. Payment of interest and principal was postponed, in some cases for as long as seven years, until all debts were repaid. (Principal is the face value of a bond, as opposed to the interest it pays.) Only two states, Mississippi and Florida, repudiated their debt at that time. Lest anyone think that lenders have short memories when they've been stiffed, it's reported that when officials from Mississippi went to London to sell a taxable Eurobond issue in 1987, they were told, to their surprise, that "the state's credit was no good. The state of Mississippi, the bankers explained, still owed London banks principal and interest on $7 million of defaulted state debt—sold 156 years earlier and repudiated in 1857!"

It is important to note that in the present day as well, repudiation of debt is much more likely to occur when the populace does not specifically vote to incur the debt in the first place. Government officials always have visions of projects they wish to fund, some of which are basic improvements and others reflect special interests. Tax-averse citizens try to limit their local government's ability to issue bonds by writing laws placed on the ballot and approved by vote. As we'll explain later, creative financing methods circumvent those restrictions. California is at the forefront of these conflicting interests.

During World War II, interest rates remained low for Treasury bonds, with fixed rates ranging from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for the 25− to 30-year bonds. Despite the low returns, when the highest federal income tax rate hit 94 percent between 1944 and 1945, the tax-exempt appeal of municipal bonds became magnetic. With 1945 came the end of the war and a suspension of long-term Treasury bond issuance for eight years. The so-called long bonds were eagerly bought in 1945 and again in 1999, when the government announced that it was going to pay down the government debt and reduce the supply of these 30-year bonds. Traders expected to see rapid price appreciation as their supply diminished.

### The Life of a Bond

However, the idea of a coupon lingers in bond terminology because a bond's interest rate is referred to as its **coupon rate**, or just plain **coupon**. The coupon rate is set as a percentage of the face value when the bond is issued. Thus, a $10,000 10-year bond with a coupon rate of 5 percent will annually pay $500, which is 5 percent of $10,000.

For the buy-and-hold investor, these two basic bond structures provide financial peace of mind because they will either enjoy a steady stream of income until—or receive a lump sum at—the time the face value of the bond is returned to them. This is called **redemption at maturity**. 

Bonds are neither simple nor stodgy. They are, rather, very rewarding. In contrast to stocks, which represent part ownership of a company, bonds are debt—pure but not always simple. Companies, municipalities, states, and the federal government issue bonds for either short-term or long-term funding needs.

#### Preparing a Bond issue

With regard to municipal bonds, an outside consultant frequently works with the municipality's finance director and lawyers to organize, collect, and represent the financial data to prospective buyers of the debt, including the underwriters. Most municipalities come to market infrequently and do not have an in-house staff.

An underwriter is the bank or brokerage house that initially buys the bonds from the issuer and then resells them to investors. Since buying a large block of debt and then reselling it into a constantly shifting market can be financially hazardous, underwriters spread their risk by having similar organizations join in the sale of the bond to investors. The resulting grouping is called an **underwriting syndicate**.

At some point in this process, the issuer decides whether or not the bond will be callable. A **call** is a kind of option that gives an issuer the right, but not the obligation, to redeem a bond issue before its maturity (due date). Many bond issues have a fixed call prior to maturity. Municipal bonds may also have extraordinary calls that certain situations trigger. Bonds are called when it is advantageous to the issuer, leaving the buyer to scratch around to find another bond investment, often at a lower yield. 

In the event of a bankruptcy, not all of an issuer's bondholders are treated equally. Some bonds have senior liens, meaning that they come first in line before other creditors if there is a financial problem. Other bond issues from the same company may have only subordinated or junior lien positions.

When a single issue consists of bonds with different redemption dates, the bonds are called **serial bonds**. These types of bonds give the issuer the flexibility of not having to pay off everything in one lump sum. Many municipal bond issues are commonly offered this way. A term bond is a longer-term bond with a final maturity date. Many corporate and U.S. government bonds are issued this way.

Once the issuer assembles all the necessary information, writers specializing in obscure prose prepare an **offering statement (OS)**, or **prospectus**. As a friend of ours once described it, only half facetiously, "[The offering statement] is written about matters that few understand and for people who will never read it." This document, produced under the issuer's aegis, sums up all the work of the professionals who created the bond and details its type, structure, special features (if any), and the strength and weaknesses of the issuer. It also describes any liabilities that might exist and the participants in the deal. If you take time to peruse it, you will learn a great deal.

#### Rating a Bond

Rating agency analysts are best known because their ratings are widely publicized and provide a recognized guide to bond purchasers. With this recognition, these analysts have become powerful players in the bond markets because their ratings strongly influence how much an issuer will have to pay to borrow money. 

Market sentiment always precedes any downgrade. Thus, ratings are broadly viewed as lagging indicators, especially in the high-yield market.

#### Launching a Bond

At its first appearance, a bond is said to be in the primary, or new, bond market. Within the primary market, Treasury bonds are sold by auction at announced times. Some large corporate bond issuers have so-called shelf registrations and allow brokers to sell bonds over time. In this case, the offering rate adjusts with the fluctuation of interest rates. Other corporate issuers, federal agencies, or municipal issuers arrange for the sale of their bonds all at once.

> "Where money goes the quickest, the risk goes even faster." - Bob Farrell, a  retired chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch.

#### A Bond's Cost and Yield

##### Determinning a Bond's Yield

The concept of yield creates the equilibrium between bonds sold at different prices. This concept is so important that we highlight it here: *Bonds are bought and sold based on yield, not on price*. This represents a key distinction between these financial instruments and stocks, which are always bought and sold in terms of price. **Yield** is the general term for the percentage return on a security investment. It is often called the **rate of return**. In bond language, it is very different from the stated coupon rate. 

##### Current Yield

When you purchase bond mutual funds, which pay dividends, you are quoted a current yield because these securities have no maturity. The dividends from bond mutual funds are a combination of bond interest and capital gains from bond sales. Therefore, they are not directly comparable to compounding bond yields, which are quoted as a yield-to-maturity or yield-to-call.

By comparison, bonds must pay scheduled interest payments, or they are in default.

##### Simple and Compound Interest

> Compound interest is called the eighth wonder of the world. It can work *for* you by creating wealth when you buy bonds, or it can work *against* you when you pay interest on your debts. It has great impartial power.

**The rule of 72**. The Rule of 72 tells you approximately how many years it takes money to double when it compounds at a particular rate of annual interest. For example, if the rate of return is 10 percent, you divide 72 by 10 and learn that it takes approximately 7.2 years for the money to double at a 10 percent compounded rate. Similarly, if the rate of return were 5 percent, it would take 14.4 years to double your money (72 ÷ 5 = 14.4 years).

##### Yield-to-Maturity

Yield-to-maturity (YTM) is the benchmark against which individual bonds are traded and quoted. YTM and the following two yield calculations all use the concept of compound interest. In the bond world, calculations assume that money never lies fallow or hidden away in a mattress. Rather, it is constantly reinvested to generate further income. Although YTM is not a perfect calculation, it is widely used because it is the unifying standard for all bond pricing.

YTM makes the following assumptions: (1) You retain ownership for the remaining life of the bond and (2) all interest payments are reinvested at the same prevailing rate (YTM). However, since interest rates change over time, your actual return on a bond does, too, unless you own a zero-coupon bond. If rates rise, for example, and you are able to reinvest the semiannual interest payments at a better rate, your actual return will be higher than quoted. If interest rates decline over the life of the bond, and you reinvest the interest at a lower rate, your actual return will be lower. Note that the key concept underpinning all this is compound interest. The YTM calculation assumes reinvestment of every interest payment, whether monthly or semiannually, at the YTM rate.

##### Duration

In general, the lower the current interest payment or coupon of the bond, the longer the duration; the higher the coupon, the shorter the duration. The duration of a zero-coupon bond is the same as its maturity. Thus, the price of zero-coupon bonds changes the most with a change in interest rates.

Let's consider a simplified example. Assume that a bond has a duration of four years, and you sell it soon after its purchase. In this case, if interest rates go up by 1 percent, the price of the bond will go down by approximately 4 percent. Similarly, if interest rates go down by 1 percent, the price of the bond will go up by approximately 4 percent.

#### Cash Flow upon Death: The estate feature

To ease concern about selling bonds in the secondary market, some issuers add a put feature to their bonds to make them more attractive to individual buyers. In the event of death of the bond-holder, the estate can receive the face value of the bonds even if the bond is selling at a discount. The advantage of this feature is that you can purchase longer-dated bonds without concern for the market value of the bonds beyond the natural life of the holder. Theoretically, your bonds would become liquid upon your death.

##### Pricing a Secondary Market Bond

When you purchase secondary market bonds, the bond may have been outstanding for some time. The bond may have little or no call protection. In this situation, the yield at the par call determines your purchase price.

The yields on Treasury bonds are benchmarks for all bonds, although as noted above, they are particularly useful for corporate and agency securities. 

The scale for muni bonds is different from the scale for corporate bonds or Treasury bonds. Each is a separate though related market. Municipal bond prices are not adjusted as quickly as Treasuries, although they also move in relation to Treasuries. This difference exists because muni bonds serve a different market, namely, buyers interested in a tax-exempt product. Demand and supply differences skew the prices.

## Bond Categories

### U.S. Treasury Securities

In 2000 and 2001, when the government was running budget surpluses, many of these older bonds were called and, thus, retired from public circulation. Owners of 30-year Treasuries that were bought in 1976 with an annual 14 percent interest rate were not happy in 2001 when they were told by the government that the party was over and that they had to part with those bonds at a time when other Treasuries were yielding about 4.5 percent.

All Treasuries are issued with a minimum face value of $1,000 and in increments of $1,000 above that. You can purchase them at auction by using the TreasuryDirect system. TreasuryDirect is a book-entry securities system, operated by the U.S. Bureau of the Public Debt, which allows you to maintain accounts directly with the U.S. Treasury. Alternatively, you can purchase all Treasury securities from a bank or a brokerage firm, either in the open market or at a Treasury auction. You can transfer most types of Treasury securities you buy from your bank or broker to your TreasuryDirect account. Upon your instructions, TreasuryDirect will get three bids for you if you want to sell in the secondary market any Treasury securities you hold in your TreasuryDirect account.

There are two principal advantages of using TreasuryDirect. First, you pay no fee and no spread (the difference between the broker's buy and sell prices) to purchase Treasuries. Second, the custodian of your Treasury securities is the federal government. Thus, the possible risks associated with a failed brokerage firm holding your securities do not exist. The two principal disadvantages of using TreasuryDirect are that you can purchase Treasury securities only at the time of an auction and that Treasury-Direct will not make a margin loan.

#### U.S. Treasury Notes and Bonds

Treasury notes and bonds both pay interest every six months and are initially sold at auction. Although both Treasury notes and bonds are issued to finance the longer-term needs of the U.S. government, they are distinguished by the terms of their maturities. The maturity of Treasury notes is set at a minimum of one year and does not exceed ten years. The government currently issues notes in 2-, 5-, and 10-year maturities. Auctions for the 2-year and 5-year notes are held monthly. The auction for the 10-year notes are held quarterly, and auctions for the 30-year bond are held quarterly beginning in 2007.

Interest income from Treasury notes and bonds is subject to federal income tax but not to state and local taxes. The interest paid at six-month intervals is taxable in the year received. In addition, if a Treasury bond is purchased for less than its face amount, in certain cases, the difference between the amount paid and its face value may be taxable as interest income over the period between the date of acquisition and the earlier of the maturity date or the date you sell the bond. If you pay more than the face amount for the bond, you may be entitled to deduct the difference between the amount paid and the face amount over the same period.

#### U.S. Treasury Bills

Treasury bills, popularly known as T-bills, are used to finance the short-term needs of the U.S. government. The 4-week bills, 13-week bills, and 26-week bills are each offered weekly and are available in commercial markets.

T-bills also differ from Treasury notes and bonds in that they do not pay interest every six months. Rather, they are sold at a discount to their face value. The difference between the discounted price you pay and the face value you receive at maturity is treated as interest income, rather than as a capital gain. Thus, T-bills pay interest only at maturity. In addition, although T-bills can be sold at any time without a penalty, you might realize a gain or a loss on the sale.

Unlike Treasury notes and bonds, you can use T-bill purchases as a short-term tax planning strategy. This is done by taking advantage of the fact that you report interest income from T-bills only in the year in which the bill comes due. To move interest income from one year to the next, buy a T-bill that has a maturity date in the next year. For example, if you bought a 26-week bill on August 1, 2006, you would report your interest income as having been received on February 1, 2007. That interest income would not be subject to tax in your 2006 federal income tax return but would be subject to tax in your 2007 return.



#### STRIPS

STRIPS is the popularly used acronym for the U.S. Treasury's Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities Program. In many ways, the approach is similar to that of T-bills in that STRIPS are zero-coupon securities sold at a discount to their face value, with interest payments made only at maturity. As with T-bills, the difference between the purchase price of STRIPS and their face value provides the return.

>  STRIPS are useful for investors who want to receive a known payment on a specific future date.

Another advantage is that the total return on STRIPS is known precisely at the date of purchase if you hold the STRIPS to their due date. In interest-paying bonds, such as Treasury bonds, the total return depends in part on the rate at which you reinvest your interest payments every six months. In addition, you can buy STRIPS to come due in any year that would be desirable for your retirement or college education program.

Even though interest from STRIPS is exempt from state and local taxes, you should consider the advantages of holding these bonds in a tax-sheltered retirement account, such as an IRA, as opposed to a taxable account. Interest on STRIPS held in a tax-sheltered retirement account is not subject to federal income tax until there is a distribution of cash from the account. However, if you hold the STRIPS outside of a tax-sheltered retirement account, you must report interest on STRIPS annually on your federal income tax return as ordinary interest income, even though you receive no cash until you redeem or sell the STRIPS. 

#### TIPS

Treasury notes and bonds pay out a fixed amount of cash, based on the coupon rate, every six months. In contrast, every six months, TIPS pay out a variable amount of cash that is initially lower than the amount paid by Treasury notes and bonds. As described next, this generally more modest coupon is designed to allow for the substantial principal accrual that is supposed to match the variability of the future cost of living. In this way, TIPS are designed to provide a guaranteed return over and above the inflation rate. Although the value of the principal varies over time, all TIPS are initially sold at auction in minimum amounts of $1,000.

TIPS provide a way to diversify your portfolio, as well as three levels of protection. First, interest payments rise with inflation. Second, the principal amount increases with inflation. Third, the Treasury guarantees that when the bond comes due, the minimum price that you will receive is the face value of the bond. Thus, the risk of a severe deflation reducing the value of the bond below its face value is eliminated. As a result, TIPS should be less volatile than other bonds with the same maturity. All primary dealers trade TIPS, though not as much as they trade other Treasuries.

### U.S. Savings Bonds

Because of these complexities, we describe the best way to capitalize on the advantages of the EE and I savings bonds under each individual description. Despite their complexity, savings bonds may be great investments. There are no fees, loads, or commissions to buy them. They are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government, will not decline in value over the years, and are not callable. They are free of state and local income tax and may be free of federal income tax if used for certain educational expenses by qualified taxpayers.

EE bonds have numerous attractions. Most important, they provide protection against inflation and deflation, plus a guaranteed lump-sum distribution at any time after you hold them for twelve months. EE bonds will never decline in value. At a minimum, the U.S. Treasury guarantees that after twenty years, an EE bond will at least double in value. If an EE bond does not double in value as the result of applying the fixed rate for twenty years, the U.S. Treasury will make a one-time adjustment at original maturity to make up the difference. EE bonds earn interest for thirty years. EE bonds purchased before June 2003 are guaranteed to double in less than twenty years. What's more, an EE bond initial investment is as low as $25, rather than $1,000 for a Treasury security. As discussed later, these bonds can provide several tax advantages, particularly with regard to higher-education expenses.

The Education Savings Bond Program, which applies to both EE bonds and I bonds, offers significant tax advantages to qualifying individuals. The Treasury Department introduced this program in 1990 as a response to the soaring costs of higher education.

### U.S. Agency Debt

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are GSEs regulated by the federal government. Fannie Mae was chartered in 1938, and Freddie Mac was chartered in 1970. Both of these GSEs assist low- and moderate-income families in buying homes by providing support and liquidity to the U.S. mortgage market. They do that by borrowing in the capital market (by selling bonds discussed in this chapter) and using the funds raised to purchase mortgages, mortgage securities, and other home loans from banks and other lenders. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are two of the largest issuers of bonds in the United States.

The Fannie Mae global notes and benchmark notes generally sell at a yield that is 20 to 25 basis points (one-fifth to one-quarter of 1 percent) above similar Treasury bonds for 2-year bonds, 25 to 30 basis points for 5-year bonds, and 30 to 35 basis points for 10-year bonds. These spreads can widen or tighten depending on market conditions.

You can avoid this risk by not buying long-term agency bonds with short calls. However, you might buy shorter maturity issues with longer call protection. For example, you might buy 5-year agency bonds with two-year call protection.

Although early call features are a risk, agency bonds of five years or less can also present an opportunity, especially in an atmosphere of rising interest rates. If agency bonds with short calls have a higher yield, consider buying them.

### U.S. Agency and Other Mortgage-Backed Securities

The government stepped in and created the Federal National Mortgage Association as part of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) on February 10, 1938, charging the association with bolstering the housing industry by expanding the flow of mortgage money. Throughout its first years of operation, the Federal National Mortgage Association primarily bought mortgages issued to lower-income people; banks held on to the lucrative returns from mortgages issued to more prosperous customers. 

The A Class security is similar to a short-term bond. Since the A Class receives a share of the interest and all the prepayments initially, it will turn out to be a shorter-term security and will have a more predictable return than the B Class or the Z Class securities. It might be possible to predict with a high degree of reliability that the A Class will retire in, say, three years. The life of and thus the return on the B Class will be more difficult to predict than the A Class, and, thus, the B Class should earn a higher return.

The Z Class nonagency CMO is generally the riskiest and should not be approached unless you or your financial adviser can do a careful analysis of the risks. Any Z Class security may be hard to analyze. Called "toxic waste" in the trade, the Z Class will also be more volatile than other mortgage securities, particularly when interest rates are moving rapidly. The Z Class has poor liquidity. Finally, the Z Class may have accounting and tax aspects that are difficult to understand.

### Municipal Bonds

**Issuers**. A key feature to understand about munis is that they are issued by states, local governments, or special public entities, such as school districts and sewer authorities. In large part, the creditworthiness and revenue sources of these various issuers determine the financial attractiveness of their bonds.

**Taxes**. Tax free is a relative term when applied to munis. Although most munis are exempt from federal income taxes, some are taxable and some are subject to the alternative minimum tax. Many munis find it impossible to escape the clutches of state or city tax departments.

### Corporate Bonds

### Bond Look-A Likes

## Options for Purchasing Bonds

> Basically, you have two choices: you can purchase individual bonds or buy them packaged together as funds.

### How to Buy Individual Bonds

THE MOST COMPELLING reason to buy individual bonds is that **bonds come due at a defined time**. Unlike bond mutual funds of any kind, individual bonds pay their face value in cash at maturity. This distinguishing characteristic is a key ingredient in many aspects of financial planning. Need a large chunk of cash for a tuition payment on December 15 ten years from now? Buy a bond that matures on December 1, 2017. Planning to retire? Buy a continuing series of bonds that come due when needed. The list is almost endless.

You can tell how any market is doing by watching the spreads. Are they widening or shrinking? Although there is much greater yield in junk than in higher-rated bonds, the downside risk of losing your principal is also much greater. If your broker tells you that the spread between the plain-vanilla bond and the junk bond is historically low, you know that you're not being paid much for the higher risk. If the spreads are really wide, then you know the market believes the bonds are very risky right now. When the market speaks, listen! Then decide how to act.

### Bond Funds The Good, The Bad, and the Worst

LET'S FACE IT. The easiest way to invest in bonds is to buy a bond mutual fund. Financial firms have catered to this strategy by creating almost 3,000 such funds and packaging them in a variety of shapes, structures, and contents. But holding an individual bond differs greatly from owning a bond fund because the fund has no due date. "**A bond mutual fund is not by definition a fixed-income product**," says Cort Smith, senior editor of *Investment Adviser*.

#### Common Ground

What remains unchanged is that trying to classify and categorize bond funds is a daunting task. Let's first review the characteristics common to all funds. No matter what the size or purpose, every bond fund has a per-share net asset value (NAV). This is the measure by which funds are valued daily. It is calculated by dividing the sum of the values, reduced by any liabilities, of all the bonds in a portfolio by the number of shares outstanding. All funds also provide a figure known as total return. This consists of a fund's cash distributions, plus or minus any change in share price during a specified period.

The NAV drops after a fund pays out the required 90 percent or more of its realized capital gains and dividends, usually in December, to reflect the lower fund value. You pay taxes on the distribution whether you owned the fund one day or one year. Before you invest, it's a good idea to find out when the fund generally makes this distribution.

Since funds are pass-through entities for tax purposes, if you hold shares of a taxable bond fund outside of a retirement account, you must report your share of the fund's interest income minus the fund's expenses. In addition, if the fund has realized capital gains, you must report your share of capital gains annually, whether the fund pays it out to you or reinvests it. If the fund has losses, they will offset the gains recognized by the fund. However, for tax purposes, if a fund has net capital losses, these capital losses may not pass through to its shareholders.

> Because there is no fixed maturity date for bond funds, they are missing the key characteristic that distinguishes an individual bond. Bonds come due, bond funds do not, although the bonds within the fund do come due. If you purchase a bond maturing in three years, you know you will get the face value of the bond back in three years. If you purchase a short-term bond fund, you don't know what your shares will be worth in three years. They may be worth more or they may be worth less.

#### Advantages

**Income**. Regular monthly income with interest and principal payments made as dividend distributions. Individual bonds usually offer semiannual payments, though some pay monthly.

**Reinvestment**. Automatic reinvestment of income. Be aware, however, that this advantage is reduced if the fund charges a fee for the reinvestment.

**Diversification**. Should one bond in a fund default, the others will supposedly smooth out any disaster ripples.

**Daily liquidity**. A simple phone call translates into a sale posted at day's end; some funds offer free check writing on the accounts.

#### Disadvantages

**Lack of fixed maturity date**. An individual bond always provides a due date on which you will receive all your money back, but a bond fund almost never does; in other words, bonds come due, bond funds don't.

**Lack of income guarantee**. With an individual bond, the payment schedule is fixed, whereas payments from the various bonds in a fund can vary.

**Capital gains tax**. You have to pay tax on capital gains realized by the fund. Funds generate capital gains when they sell bonds to raise cash for redemptions or trade securities. Funds that have a high turnover rate, a measure of annual portfolio change, are said to be tax inefficient when they generate capital gains, because the gains are passed through to the shareholders. **Funds can't pass through tax losses.**

**Susceptibility to market risk**. Even conservative Treasury bond funds are subject to market risk. For example, *BusinessWeek* warns: "If the yield on a 10-year Treasury jumps by half a percentage point from 5 percent now, it will lose about 10 percent of its market value." That means that even the bond fund holding the safest securities could still experience a market decline that may continue for many years.

#### Checking the Costs

The largest and most blatant cost is referred to as the load. In effect, this is the sales commission earned by the person who sells you the fund. Funds that have such sales commissions are known as load funds. With these funds, you generally lose money right from the start because the load is deducted from the amount of money you initially invest. Critical comments about front-end loads, as they're called, have led fund companies sometimes to allocate the loads over a number of years or to tack them on at the end.

Other costs, decidedly camouflaged, include back-end loads (yup—some funds charge you to get out of them); annual management fees to cover administrative expenses; advertising fees on the no-load and load funds (they're officially designated as 12b-1 fees); plus all the transaction fees that the fund pays when it buys and sells the bonds in its portfolio. And there are more: some funds have loads on reinvested dividends, exchange fees if you want to transfer from one fund to another, frequent transaction charges, and shareholder accounting costs.

If you are a do-it-yourself investor and looking to keep your costs down, you may purchase no-load funds. Fund families like Vanguard and Fidelity have no-load funds and even lower-cost funds if you have substantial assets to invest. Some funds have instituted retirement shares for 401(k)s and IRAs, which over the long term may have the highest fees of all and are designated by a different letter. Other fund families skip the alphabet soup and have specially designated funds for high-net-worth individuals that have the lowest cost. For example, Vanguard has Admiral Funds, T. Rowe Price has Summit Funds, and Fidelity has Spartan Funds for substantial depositors.

We're biased in favor of funds with the lowest costs. We were, therefore, quite pleased to read about work undertaken by Morningstar, the fund tracking and rating company. As reported in November 2001, funds with the lowest fees performed the best overall: "In areas ranging from ultrashort bond funds to the multisector and intermediate-term bond categories, we found that the lowest-cost quartile of funds posted total returns over the year through October 31 that were better than those of the high-expense offerings."

What's more, Morningstar found that the **higher-cost funds took on added risk** in order to boost the yield and compensate for the added fund costs. The article concludes by pointing out, "If you pay less, you're likely to get better returns and lower risk. That's not a bad combination."

### Bonds Funds A Taxing Matter

#### Tax-Exempt Funds

Between October 2005 and October 2006, municipal bond funds returned 4.22 percent compared to taxable bond funds, which returned 4.16 percent, according to Morning-star.Furthermore, Peter J. DeGroot, vice president and head of municipal strategies at Lehman Brothers, reported that in August 2006 the tax-adjusted returns on municipal bonds for those in the highest tax bracket were 9.63 percent during the previous ten years, compared to 6.88 percent for taxable bonds.Past performance is no predictor of future returns, but if we can reduce expenses, we have a better chance of coming out ahead.

Check out the yields on the state-specific funds compared to the national funds to see if you can avoid paying state taxes as well, while helping to support the state economy by being a lender. Although you may think you should buy a fund with the name of your state on it, there are times when a national muni fund would be more advantageous. Funds may purchase bonds subject to the AMT in order to boost yields. If you're subject to this tax, you might want to check into the fund's policy and review its portfolio before you buy. You might earn more, on an after-tax basis, in a fund that holds no AMT bonds than you would in a fund that holds only bonds of your state of residence.

##### High Yield (Junk Bonds)

the credit quality of municipal bonds varies tremendously. Bonds at the lower end of the spectrum are forced to offer a higher yield to attract investors. Some financial institutions buy these up and package them as high-yield municipal bond funds. These funds suffered great setbacks in 1999 and 2000 as a result of the credit crunch following the bankruptcy of Orange County, California. Investors in a Heartland Advisers fund, for example, saw the fund's value decline by more than 70 percent in one day. These losses were the result of illiquidity in the high-yield market, which limited the ability of the pricing services to adequately value the bonds. The fund manager decided to retain higher values than were justified. Heartland management repriced the funds when they learned about the problem.

In short, high-yield municipal bond funds are every bit as risky as corporate high-yield bond funds. Buyers of these funds must be ever vigilant. The funds are available as open-end mutual funds and as closed-end funds.

Case Studies

Let's put these theories to the test now and see how they pan out when the rubber meets the road. For most people, that happens when they realize they must plan for a life transition or when they suddenly find themselves faced with one. These events require decisions about how to proceed.

#### Changing Course

Earl was single and living in New York, a high-tax jurisdiction, we suggested that he use New York State tax-free municipal bonds as his savings vehicle. These bonds would be free of federal, New York State, and New York City taxes, a huge plus for a New York resident.

1. Earl must sell his co-op, which would net him $125,000 after he paid off his mortgage, taxes, and closing costs. We would invest the $125,000 in a ladder of New York State tax-free municipal bonds. The bonds would have a minimum life of ten years, be noncallable, and return 4 percent interest tax free. These bonds would be worth about $185,000 at the end of the ten-year period if all the income was reinvested in additional New York State municipal bonds yielding 4 percent.
2. Earl would save $25,000 each year for ten years, and we would purchase additional New York State tax-free municipal bonds at 4 percent interest. If Earl made these lifestyle changes, he would be living well below his means. Thus, he should be able to save $25,000 per year. These savings each year would enable him to accumulate about $312,000. The $312,000 plus the $185,000 would get him to his $500,000 goal.
3. We made sure that Earl had sufficient disability insurance, medical insurance, auto insurance, and an umbrella policy sufficient to protect him against as many risks as possible.

To carry out his plan, we helped Earl create a custom bond ladder composed of tax-free municipal bonds from only New York State issuers, which came due between five and fifteen years. If Earl is serious about his planned transition, he will save his money; this will enable him to escape from the "golden handcuffs" of corporate America and begin his new life. His financial plan is sound and attainable.

#### Meeting a Need for Safty

Sean left a large corporate employer to become an independent consultant. At the time he was setting up his new business, his investment portfolio was completely in stocks, with most in the high-tech sector. When Sean came to us for financial advice, we advised him to sell all of them. When he asked whether we were making a market call that stocks were going to decline substantially in value we said we were not. The reason for our advising him to sell was that his finances could not sustain the downside risk of a stock decline. He was creating a new business and it was not clear how long it would take to launch it and make it profitable. It was also uncertain how much cash Sean would need to fund his new venture. If his new venture needed cash, it could not financially survive a serious stock market decline.

After eighteen months, however, Sean's business became profitable, and it's now sustaining itself. Although his economic situation is better, Sean's income is still somewhat unpredictable. He needs to build up his cash flow. He has added municipal bonds to his mix to reduce his taxes as well as to provide for a good current income. Because Sean lives in Texas, which has no state income tax, he can buy municipal bond issues from any state, which will also increase his portfolio's diversity. He decided to keep some of his funds in cash equivalents, and with the rest he created a five-year bond ladder to increase his return and still provide for liquidity.

#### Planning for College Expenses

Mr. and Mrs. Suburban, a young couple living in California, earn enough money to be in at least the 25 percent federal income tax bracket and a 9 percent California income tax bracket. The Suburbans have a newborn daughter named Maya. One of their financial objectives is to begin to save enough to finance at least part of Maya's college education.

1. The Suburbans could set up a custodial account for Maya with a lump-sum contribution of $25,000. With these funds, they could buy noncallable Treasury bonds yielding 5 percent or $1,250 (25,000 × .05). Since the $1,250 of interest earned on the Treasury bonds is less than $1,700 for 2006, the interest income would be very lightly taxed because it would be taxed under Maya's Social Security number. In other words, because the $1,250 of interest income is below the dollar amount specified by the IRS ($1,700 for 2006), the so-called kiddie tax would not apply. If the kiddie tax did apply, some of Maya's taxable income would be taxed to Mr. and Mrs. Suburban in their federal income tax return. However, putting money into a custodial account has disadvantages. The money in the account may be used only for Maya's needs and expenses and may not be used for the Suburbans' personal use. Also, colleges may provide less financial aid to students who have money in their own names.
2. The Suburbans could buy EE or I U.S. savings bonds in their own name. If the Suburbans earned less than a certain amount of income in the year they cash in the savings bonds and use the money for Maya's college tuition, then some or all of the interest income earned on the savings bonds might be tax free. The Suburbans were distressed about the many qualifications required for this tax break. Because of the many uncertainties, the Suburbans decided not to buy savings bonds to fund Maya's education.
3. We did not recommend a Section 529 plan to save for college because the money in these plans is locked up in mutual fund-type investments with annual fees. In addition, these funds are exclusively for college expenses. Unless they paid a penalty, the Suburbans would not be allowed to access this money if they had unanticipated emergencies or transitions. This is another reason to keep the money in their name rather than in Maya's name.
4. The Suburbans decided to purchase zero-coupon tax-free California municipal bonds yielding about 4 percent and coming due when Maya starts college at eighteen. If they are successful in investing $5,000 per year for fifteen years and can earn an average of 4 percent on their bonds, they will have about $100,000 in their college fund. In their tax bracket, a 4 percent tax-free rate is equivalent to a taxable return of more than 6 percent so the municipal bonds are a better deal for them from every perspective. All the earnings on these California municipal bonds will be free of federal and California state income tax. If they need the money themselves, they could sell one or more of the bonds to raise cash.

#### An Unanticipated Transition

Barbara and her husband, Jim, lived in New York. They worked long hours, she as an investment banker and Jim as a writer. They loved their work so much that they gave it priority in their lives. The result was an unanticipated transition, a divorce. Barbara won custody of Bobby, their only child, who was twelve years old. In the property settlement, Barbara thought she did well because she received assets worth $2 million consisting of their Manhattan co-op residence ($1 million after paying off the mortgage); their beach house, which she loved, ($500,000); and her IRA, which was fully invested in stock ($500,000). It is not unusual in a divorce for women to take the house or houses and let their ex-husbands take much of the financial assets. Although Barbara received more than half of the assets, she didn't do as well as she thought because she didn't take into account the taxes that would be payable on the sale of the real estate.

After the divorce, Barbara discovered that her financial world had changed drastically because she was going into debt even though she made a handsome living. Barbara could not continue her predivorce lifestyle in Manhattan and at the beach. Without both her income and Jim's, she could not cover all of her coop and other living expenses including Bobby's private school expenses.

1. Find a rental apartment in New Jersey that has access to a train to Manhattan and a good public school system for Bobby.
2. Sell her Manhattan co-op and the beach house. Take the after-tax proceeds from the sales and use the money to fund a custom bond ladder composed of tax-free New Jersey municipal bonds since Barbara was now a New Jersey resident. We recommended that Barbara have a plan to accumulate $2 million in her custom bond ladder. At a 4 percent tax-free return, this $2 million fund would provide $80,000 in tax-free income. Once Barbara had a cash flow of $80,000 per year of tax-free income, she could consider taking a less-stressful but lower-paying job because her tax-free income would be enough to supplement her earned income.
3. Sell the stock in her IRA and buy short-term agency bonds and longer-term TIPS bonds to protect against inflation and to have a secure retirement account.
4. Have some bonds come due in six to nine years to fund Bobby's college tuition, beginning at age eighteen. Though Barbara was told that it's likely it will take Bobby five or six years to graduate, she is hoping she will have the financial resources at that time to move back to Manhattan or buy a house in New Jersey.

#### Socially Conscious Investing

Mikala discovered that if she purchased individual bonds, she would have very low expenses on her investments and there was a huge selection.

Mikala decided that she generally did not want to put her funds at risk. She anticipated having little earned income so she would be in a low tax bracket. She had a need for some cash income and for ongoing income. However, she did not have any specific milestones that had to be met.

We advised her to purchase some taxable bonds to boost her marginal income tax rate into the 25 percent bracket. Taxable bonds she could consider included U.S. Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, agency bonds, and CDs. Mikala considered investing some of her funds in bonds of corporations that supported her beliefs. After investigating the possibilities, she realized that no corporation would exactly meet her criteria. Dig deep enough and you can always find problems. Mikala knew that leaving the money in the bank was not an alternative because the bank could turn around and lend the money for things she might find objectionable. Mikala realized she would have to compromise both to protect her assets and to be paid for the risk she was taking. As a result, Mikala decided to purchase agency bonds because she was willing to support the mortgage market and help people achieve their goal of home ownership. Some of the agency bonds were also exempt from state income taxes.

Once her federal marginal tax bracket was high enough, the majority of Mikala's funds should be invested in tax-free municipal bonds. Within that category, bonds are issued for all kinds of purposes. There are certain bonds that require voter approval (GO bonds). Voter approval means that the voters support the project and are willing to pay for it. All GO bonds would fit Mikala's criteria. Investing responsibly would not mean that she had to accept less return than other investors receive.

GO bonds are frequently issued for the support of schools. Since education was an essential value in her life, Mikala decided that she would use her money to invest in schools by purchasing school bonds, in effect, lending money to communities to help them build and equip schools.

Mikala also decided to purchase state-issued housing bonds since they provide below-market-rate mortgages to low-income families. These mortgages can be quite risky if they do not have strong financial guarantees. However, the ratings on Mikala's bonds were AA to AAA, depending on the strength of the guarantees.

Mikala also liked water and sewer bonds, which are also GO bonds, because they provide fresh water and maintain good hygiene for a community. Wastewater treatment plants were not her favorite investment, but she saw the need for those services. In this way, she was voting with her money for the establishment of services that provide for the health and well-being of the people around her.

All these bonds pay interest every six months. There is also no state or federal tax on the interest from the municipal bonds because she purchased them in her home state of Pennsylvania. Mikala made sure that all her bonds were insured to give her belt-and-suspenders protection. The default rate on the kinds of bonds she selected was very low. Because of the insurance, Mikala's portfolio had bonds with AAA ratings.

Mikala laddered her portfolio to minimize both the inflation risk and the reinvestment risk. Although there is no perfect investment that will protect against inflation, Mikala knew that she would always have some funds to reinvest in the event of higher rates, thus, mitigating to some extent the impact of inflation. Also, she knew that she could sell some of the bonds with short maturities to purchase bonds selling at higher rates. She could also choose to purchase inflation-protected bonds, but they would reduce her cash flow since they have low current-interest payments, and she would have to pay taxes on the imputed annual income.

## Maximizing Profits

We review a variety of techniques and strategies that will help you determine when to buy and sell bonds, how to take advantage of tax benefits, how to minimize the risks to your capital, and how to increase your returns.

### Knowing When to Buy and Sell

> There are two types of bond buyers: those who engage in a **buyand-hold** strategy and those who **try to time the market**. We view the former as investors and the latter as speculators. Those in the first group buy bonds and, in the absence of personal financial or strategic reasons to sell, hold them until they come due. The market timers in the second group, however, seek to anticipate interest-rate movements and then capitalize on short-term market swings by a strategy of in-and-out trading.

We endorse a buy-and-hold strategy because you only need to make one right decision: when to buy. The variations in a bond's price while you hold it are not a serious concern because you will be paid both your scheduled interest and the face value of the bond at its due date. Therefore, unless you hold long-term bonds, the ups and downs of a bond's price should not matter to you if you can hold the bond until it comes due at face value. When you trade bonds, however, you must make two right decisions to be successful: when to buy and when to sell. We recommend to our clients that they avoid market timing and leave this activity to traders who move big positions and watch the trading action all day every day. Making one right decision of this nature is hard enough; making two is a risky choice.

#### The Yield Curve

A yield curve is the name given to a chart that plots the interest rates being paid by bonds of the same *credit quality* but different maturities. In the chart, the interest rate is found on the vertical axis and the maturity on the horizontal axis. Short-term rates are controlled by the Federal Reserve (the Fed) by changing the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend to each other. That, in turn, affects the rates banks pay depositors and charge for loans. These rates affect all short-term rates, which, in turn, affect economic activity and inflation. Investors' expectations control long-term rates. The yield curve is a graphic description of borrowers' and lenders' actions in response to the changes in the costs of doing business.

Experts invariably disagree on which way interest rates will go next or on what the shape of the yield curve means for interest rates in the future. Although this is disappointing, you will still get significant information from studying the yield curve because it can tell you when to be careful and when an advantage may appear. The yield curve will help you decide how to maximize your return within the context of your own personal investment plan.

The yield curve has three classic shapes: ascending, flat, and inverted. Each, as depicted in the examples that follow, tells a different story.

**Ascending yield curve**. It's not unusual for there to be an ascending yield curve for, say, the first ten years of the period plotted on the curve and then a flatter curve from year ten to year thirty. A spread of about 3 percent between the 3-month Treasury bill and the 30-year Treasury bond would not be unusual in an ascending yield curve. At times when the yield curve is ascending, consider buying longer-term bonds to capture the additional yield while staying within the parameters of your bond ladder.

**Flat yield curve**. When the yield curve is flat, you receive more or less the same interest rate whether you buy a short-, intermediate-, or long-term bond. At these times, we generally advise our clients, within the context of their financial plan, to stay in the intermediate range because of greater market uncertainty about long-term bonds and the possibility of declining short-term rates. In that case, it usually makes sense to buy bonds with maturities only as far out on the yield curve as is comfortable until it flattens. This is called the "peak" of the yield curve. For the longer-term bonds, with maturities after that point, you may not be paid enough for the risk.

**Inverted yield curve**. If there is an inverted yield curve, bonds with a short maturity have a higher yield than long-term bonds. An inverted yield curve is infrequent and sometimes indicates that a significant economic change is coming, such as a recession. In 2006, many pundits argued that the inverted curve did not indicate a recession because the demand of foreign buyers and hedge funds exceeded the supply of bonds, thus, driving long-term interest rates down.

The threat that you will have to average down (get a lower interest rate) when your bonds come due is what's called reinvestment risk. In the early 1980s, for example, all interest rates were sky high and the yield curve was steeply inverted. During this period, many very conservative CD buyers bought six-month CDs and kept rolling them over every six months as they came due at lower and lower rates as the years went by. Unfortunately for them, they missed a huge buying opportunity to lock in long-term Treasury bonds yielding 15 percent in the early 1980s. In the early 2000s, the yield curve flattened and then inverted with the same result: high short-term CD rates attracted the individual investor, while professional investors scrambled to lock in longer-term rates in anticipation of the decline in rates overall.

### Strategies for Deciding When to Sell

We do not recommend market timing, but there are many times when it's appropriate to restructure your bond portfolio and sell bonds before they come due.

- **Monitor the changes that may occur in your federal tax bracket**. A substantial increase or decrease in your federal income tax bracket might lead you to a decision to sell municipal bonds and purchase taxable bonds, or vice versa. For example, your federal tax bracket might decrease as a result of your retirement, large business losses, substantial charitable contributions, or other deductions, or increase due to a big promotion, a great business opportunity, or an inheritance.
- **Check state tax rates if you move from one state to another**. A change in your residence from one high-tax state to another high-tax state or from a low-tax state to a high-tax state can trigger a need for portfolio change to minimize your taxes. In each of these cases, you might sell the municipal bonds issued by one state and buy municipal bonds issued by the other state. For example, if you move from New York to California, you might want to sell your New York municipal bonds and buy California municipal bonds to take advantage of the California state tax exemption for in-state bonds. California would tax your New York municipal bond interest.
- **Follow changes in the federal tax code**. Some tax-free municipal bonds, for example, are subject to the AMT. They're called AMT bonds. Discussion continues in Congress about modifying or abolishing the AMT; any tinkering with it could affect the desirability of owning or selling AMT bonds.
- **Profit from price gains**. Consider selling if you have a substantial gain on your bonds and you have a noninvestment use for the money or wish to invest in another asset class.

### Strategies for Finding Bargain Bonds

- **Study the Treasury bond yield curve**. Determine the most desirable maturity range based on your needs. Suppose you were considering the purchase of a bond with a five-year maturity. You might find that purchasing a bond in a longer or shorter maturity might provide a better return as well as support your particular situation. Also, compare the yields on outstanding Treasury bills, notes, and bonds in the same maturity. The off-the-run securities might yield a little extra because there is less demand for them. Maybe you wanted to purchase a longer-term bond. The large projected federal government surplus and the government buyback of 30-year Treasuries in the 1990s resulted in a sharp decrease in the yield of long-term Treasuries in 2000. However, when the projected surplus significantly diminished in 2001, the yield increased because the potential supply of Treasuries going forward seemed ready to increase.
- **Compare the Treasury yields to tax-exempt municipal bond yields**. Even if you're in a lower tax bracket, municipal bonds might make sense for you if their yields approach those of Treasuries. There's a lot of historical data supporting the premise that on average the yields on highly rated, tax-free municipal bonds are normally 80 percent to 90 percent of Treasury bonds for similarly dated maturities. If yields on tax-free municipal bonds are greater than 90 percent of Treasuries, as they were for a time in 2000 and 2003, the municipals would be a good buy because they yield almost as much as Treasuries, and the income is tax free. In this situation, even the taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket benefit from munis.
- **When buying corporate bonds, compare the returns of subsectors in the same maturities**. All corporate bonds do not move in unison. By comparing the yields of automobile companies to rail companies, for example, you will understand that there is a yield differential for similarly rated bonds in different market sectors. Junk bonds became relatively cheap in 1989, 1990, and 2001 because of the large number of defaults and the threat of more of the same caused by the recessions in those years. Thirty percent of the junk bonds defaulted in the early 1990s, although they became a buy after the yields had increased significantly and the threat of default had diminished. In 2007, junk bonds were very expensive; consequently, they should be avoided.
- **Consider investing in bonds that have had many rating downgrades but may appear promising to you because you believe there will be an upgrade**. In 2006, for example, New York City bond ratings were upgraded, signaling that these bonds were becoming safer. This perception of safety was a consequence of New York's improved fiscal health, a credit rating upgrade, and investors' growing confidence in Mayor Michael Bloomberg. It helps if the bonds are insured, just in case your best guess turns out to be wrong.

### Strategies for Staying Away from Overvalued Bonds

- **Compare the Treasury yield curve to the yield curve of other taxable market sectors**. Professional bond traders always speak of the yield above Treasuries as a way to describe how a bond is priced. If you're not getting a satisfactory risk premium above the Treasury yield, don't take the risk. Buy the Treasury.
- **Watch out for junk bonds**. When the yield spread between Treasuries and junk bonds moves to within 200 basis points (2 percent), as it did in 2007, it's an indication that junk bonds are comparatively expensive.
- **Compare maturities**. If the yield curve is relatively flat, there is little or no risk premium being offered for buying longer-term bonds. As a general rule, you want to be in short- or medium-term maturities if you are not getting enough interest to warrant longer-term bonds.
- **Compare asset classes among corporate bonds**. Some sectors are often cheaper as a result of market news, but they may not have been repriced yet to reflect the increased risk. When a sector is being flailed by the media, prices drop substantially.
- **Ask questions about corporate bond yield spreads over Treasuries**. The yield spreads indicate the market's perception of corporate strength, and they fluctuate based on rumor and market news. If a yield looks too good to be true, it probably is.

### Strategies for When Interest Rates are High or Rising

When interest rates go up, there is a hue and cry that bond investors will take serious losses. But we always love it when interest rates are rising because it creates wonderful opportunities for investing money at higher rates and increasing our income. For example, if interest rates go up from 4 percent to 6 percent per year over a period of time, an investor can increase cash flow by 50 percent. 

> Remember, when the commentators say it is a bad time for bonds because rates are rising and prices are falling, you can say, **let the bad times roll**.

- **Quickly invest your cash**. If you hold cash or cash equivalents, you can now invest the cash in intermediate-term bonds at a more favorable rate of return than when rates were lower. This can only be good news. Intermediate Treasury bond investments should be in the two- to ten-year range if the yield curve is fairly flat. Intermediate municipal bonds should be in the seven- to fifteen-year range if they have a steeper yield curve.
- **Consider cashing in your bank CDs**. This strategy holds true only for a bank CD purchased from a bank and not for a CD purchased from a broker, a so-called brokered CD. If you hold a CD purchased directly from a bank, take advantage of the fact that the principal of the CD never goes down. If interest rates have risen significantly, you might cash in your bank CD, pay the penalty, and then reinvest your cash in a higher-yielding and equally safe investment, such as an intermediate-term Treasury, agency bond, or even another 5-year CD. To discourage this strategy, some banks charge one year's interest or more. The penalty might be higher than the interest that you earned and, thus, will reduce your principal. Other banks charge between a three-month and six-month interest penalty. Check with your bank on the withdrawal penalties before you invest. On the other hand, if interest rates are low, you can use bank CDs as a place to keep your principal safe until rates move up.
- **Cash in U.S. savings bonds that have been held for twelve months or more**. If you hold EE or I savings bonds, you can cash them in after you hold them for twelve months or more. If you hold them for less than five years, you will pay a penalty equal to three months' interest, but if you hold them for more than five years, there is no penalty. The key point here is that you never lose any of the amount you invested or the accrued interest with a savings bond (except possibly the three-month interest penalty). If interest rates have risen significantly, you can cash in your savings bonds and earn even more income by reinvesting in safe but higher-yielding bonds. Keep in mind that if you cash in your EE or I bonds, you must pay federal income tax on the accrued interest.
- **Buy premium bonds**. If you might sell bonds before maturity, premium bonds will hold their value longer in a rising interest-rate market. But keep in mind that if you spend all your interest income, you will be spending some of your principal as well.
- **Buy new issues**. When rates are rising, you might consider buying new issues because new issues are price leaders. The brokers are hoping they will not have to take a loss on their existing inventory and do not mark down their prices quickly. New issues are priced at the current market value.
- **Hold on to inflation-protected bonds**. Inflation-protected bonds such as TIPS and I savings bonds are a good hedge if interest rates are rising as a result of inflation. In that case, the principal of your TIPS and I savings bonds will increase in value if you hold them until their due date.
- **Swap your bonds**. There are many opportunities to swap your bonds, although it's better to sell twenty-five bonds or more to get a better price. Three kinds of swaps are suggested:
  - **Swap short-term bonds for intermediate- or long-term bonds**. A swap will allow you to lock in higher returns if longer-term bonds are yielding significantly more than short-term bonds. In this case, you may either take a gain or sell at a small loss. While selling at a loss might not initially seem like a great idea, keep in mind that your loss will be small if the bonds that you are selling will come due within two years, because in this case they should be priced close to their face value.
  - **Do a tax swap and take a tax loss**. This is a trading strategy that one-ups the tax collector. It involves selling any low-interest coupon bonds you own that are selling below their purchase price. This generates a tax loss. Simultaneously, you buy new bonds to lock in the same or a higher return. In the 1970s, when interest rates were constantly rising, tax swaps were considered every year. The last quarter of the year was called the tax-swapping season.
  - **Upgrade your credit quality**. Swaps can be done to upgrade the credit quality of your portfolio by swapping a weaker credit for a stronger one at a time when the spread between better credits and weaker credits has narrowed.

### Strategies for When Interest Rates are Low or Falling

- **Don't stay in cash**. When interest rates are low, you may believe that it will be best to keep your money in a low-yielding money market fund and wait for interest rates to rise. Although this strategy may work out well, many other times staying in cash may prove costly because the longer you wait for rates to go up, the higher the rates must go to compensate you for waiting and earning lower returns. For example, if money market rates are 2 percent and 5-year bond rates are 4 percent, if rates stay the same, you have lost 2 percent per year for the period involved. Even if rates do move up later, they must move up enough not only to make up for the lost interest but also to make up for the risk that the rates may not rise. Staying in cash is a type of market timing and is unlikely to work out favorably over the long term.
- **Buy EE bonds**. EE savings bonds allow you to lock in the current return being paid by the Treasury for at least twenty years without losing any principal or accrued interest. If interest rates kick up in the future, you can redeem your EE bonds, take your gain, and then buy higher-yielding bonds.
- **Take a capital gain**. When interest rates are low or falling, consider selling some of your bonds to take a capital gain. However, this strategy makes sense only if you intend to invest the proceeds in another asset class, such as equities or real estate, or have a need for cash for a personal expenditure, such as buying or improving your home. There is little or no advantage in taking a capital gain and then investing in similar bonds once you pay transaction costs related to selling and buying and taxes on the gain.
- **Consider the secondary market**. Investigate the secondary bond market for previously owned bonds. When interest rates are falling, you might consider buying bonds in the secondary market rather than new issues. New issues, being price leaders, may have lower yields at these times.
- **Consider constructing a barbell portfolio**. When interest rates are low, investors flock to intermediate-term bonds, pushing the yields of these bonds down. In this situation, you might increase the yield of your bond portfolio by using a barbell structure. In this structure, you split your portfolio between long- and short-term bonds (each constituting one part of the barbell). In doing so, you capture the higher returns of 20− to 30-year long-term bonds and their gains if interest rates decline, while having ready access to the cash in short-term bonds that have maturities of two years or less. The combination of long-term and short-term bonds provides an intermediate-term average maturity and portfolio duration, which may be higher than the return on the intermediate-term bonds.
- **Buy bond funds with longer-term maturities**. When interest rates are falling, longer-term bond funds will give you the highest total return. If you're adventurous, consider target maturity funds and long-term corporate bond funds. If you're more conservative, consider long-term Treasury or municipal bond funds.

### Investing for Tax Advantages

Always view purchases of bonds and other investments in terms of their after-tax returns. To do so, you must first determine your highest federal income tax bracket. You then compare the return you would get on an investment that's taxable with the return on one that's not. The result is called the taxable equivalent yield.

Taxable bond rate x ( 1 - Your top marginal tax bracket) = Tax-free bond rate

For example, assume that the taxable bond rate is 7 percent and your top federal income tax bracket is 28 percent. The computation would be made as follows: .07 × (1 - .28) = (.07 × 0.72) = .0504 or 5.04 percent. In this example, a taxable yield of 7 percent is equivalent to a tax-free yield of 5.04 percent if you're in the 28 percent federal marginal tax bracket. Thus, if you can get more than 5.04 percent on a tax-free bond, the tax-free bond would give you a higher after-tax return than a 7 percent taxable bond. This computation doesn't take into account state income taxes.

#### A Reminder About Taxes

- **Income exempt from federal income tax**. Interest from tax-exempt municipal bonds and dividends from tax-exempt municipal bond funds, but not interest from taxable municipal bonds and taxable municipal bond funds. For some taxpayers, interest from AMT municipal bonds are subject to the AMT.
- **income exempt from state income tax but not federal income tax**. Interest from Treasury bonds, notes, bills, STRIPS, TIPS, savings bonds, and certain agency bonds as well as dividends from certain taxable municipal bonds and bond funds that hold these securities.
- **Income deferred from current federal and state income tax but ultimately subject to tax**. Interest from EE and I savings bonds until you redeem them. Even when you redeem them, they are not subject to state income tax. In addition, interest from EE and I savings bonds may be tax-free if used for education expenses by qualifying taxpayers. Fixed deferred annuities are tax deferred until payout begins and then fully taxable. All interest from any bonds in a tax-sheltered retirement account is tax deferred until it is distributed and then the income is subject to federal income tax at ordinary income tax rates no matter what the source of the interest income. State taxation of these distributions varies from state to state.
- **Income subject to federal income tax immediately**. Unless in a tax-sheltered retirement account, income from all taxable zero-coupon bonds, taxable municipal bonds, and AMT bond income for some taxpayers.

#### Strategies for Placing Bonds in Tax-Effective Accounts

- **Always place all tax-exempt municipal bonds in taxable accounts**. These bonds should never be placed in tax-sheltered retirement accounts (unless the yield on tax-exempt municipal bonds is higher than taxable bonds) because distributions from these accounts are always treated as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes even if they result from tax-exempt municipal bonds.
- **Place EE and I savings bonds in taxable accounts**. The tax deferral is wasted in a tax-sheltered retirement account, even assuming you can get a trustee to hold them.
- **Hold taxable STRIPS and TIPS in tax-sheltered retirement accounts**. Some of the interest from these securities results in imputed or phantom income that is currently subject to tax if held in taxable accounts but creates no current tax liability if the securities are held in tax-sheltered retirement accounts.
- **If you place taxable bonds and bond funds in tax-sheltered retirement accounts, the advantage is that the taxable interest and capital gains are deferred and not subject to current tax**. The disadvantage is that long-term capital gains generated in these accounts are treated as ordinary income when they are distributed. Thus, if a bond is held for more than one year, you have converted long-term capital gains, which are lightly taxed, into ordinary income, which may be heavily taxed. In addition, there is no tax benefit for losses realized in a tax-sheltered retirement account. Note that there is a 10 percent tax penalty on an early withdrawal before age 59½ from a tax-sheltered retirement account.
- **If you place bonds that are infrequently traded in taxable accounts, any long-term capital gains are lightly taxed in 2007 at a 15 percent federal income tax rate**.

#### Strategies for Individuals in High Tax Brackets

Tax-exempt municipal bonds are the best and last great tax shelter for individual investors. Individuals who are in high tax brackets benefit most from an investment in tax-exempt municipal bonds. However, even taxpayers in the 25 percent tax bracket generally can benefit from an investment in these bonds because the interest income is not subject to federal income tax. In 2007, a single taxpayer reached the 25 percent federal income tax bracket when the taxpayer's taxable income exceeded $31,850; married taxpayers reached the 25 percent federal tax bracket when their taxable income exceeded $63,700.

However, there are two other categories of municipal bonds to watch out for: one category is municipal bonds subject to the AMT. They're called AMT bonds because their interest income is subject to the federal AMT for certain individuals. The AMT keeps changing, and it is unclear who will be hit by this tax in any year.

The other bond category is called taxable municipal bonds. The interest income from these bonds is subject to federal income tax but not subject to the AMT. Taxable municipal bonds provide a higher interest rate than tax-exempt municipal bonds, and many are insured; some are zero-coupon bonds. Highly rated taxable municipal bonds are excellent investments for your tax-sheltered retirement accounts.

#### Strategies for Tax-Sheltered Retirement Accounts and Individuals in Low Tax Brackets

For tax-sheltered retirement accounts and low-tax-bracket individuals:

- **Consider STRIPS, TIPS, Treasuries, agencies, taxable muni bonds, and highly rated corporate bonds**. They are safe. The adverse tax consequences of STRIPS and TIPS (because they generate phantom income) will not result in a significant amount of tax if the low-bracket taxpayer has little or no other taxable income.
- **Check out AMT bonds**. If it's clear that you will not be subject to the AMT currently or in the future, buying AMT bonds may be an opportunity for you. They often provide 20 to 30 basis points more yield than non-AMT bonds, frequently without any sacrifice of credit quality. However, keep in mind that AMT bonds may be difficult to sell at a good price. In addition, even if you are not subject to the AMT today, you might be subject to it in the future. Some muni funds may hold a high proportion of these bonds to boost their yield. Always investigate what percent of a bond fund is held in AMT bonds to maximize your return after tax. The fund company can give you this information.
- **Consider selling your tax-free municipal bonds**. If you are no longer in a high-enough tax bracket to benefit from the tax exemption, you may do better on an after-tax basis by selling your municipal bonds and buying higher-yielding taxable securities including taxable municipal bonds and AMT bonds. This may also be the time to buy a fixed immediate annuity.
- **Redeem your EE and I savings bonds and buy safe plain-vanilla bonds, such as Treasury bonds, to generate current cash flow**. However, the redemption will be a taxable event unless the income from such bonds can be used for educational purposes by qualifying taxpayers.
- **Buy TIPS and I savings bonds for safety and to provide protection against inflation**.

### Investing and Risk Tolerance
#### Practical Considerations for Assessing Risk Tolerance

If you've read this far, you've probably already assessed your need for income, the level of risk you're willing to assume with your bond investments, and your capacity to actually sustain losses. Now consider the following questions:

- **If your bond portfolio declined in value would you panic and sell your bonds?** If so, you probably have a low risk tolerance and failed to keep in mind that your bonds will come due at their face value. To be at peace with your bond investments, you should consider buying only short- and intermediate-term bonds that you can hold until they come due. If you can hold bonds until they come due, you will have no reason to panic or sell your bonds prematurely.
- **Would you engage in an interest-rate play by buying 30-year bonds with an eye toward selling for a significant gain if interest rates decline? Would you buy a bond with a 12 percent yield and take the risk of losing a significant amount of your capital?** If so, you are a speculator and should have a high capacity for loss.
- **Is your portfolio heavily weighted in equities and illiquid investments such as real estate?** If so, a conservative bond portfolio will provide a safe foundation enabling you to take on more risk with other investments and business ventures.

### Starting Out with Less than $25,000 to Invest

If you have less than $25,000 to invest, buy short-term or intermediate-term bonds. Don't buy long-term bonds, because you can't afford the market risk if you need your funds. You might not need credit diversification, but you might need maturity diversification. How would you deal with that? Buy the following short- or intermediate-term bonds:

- Treasury bonds
- TIPS
- Agency bonds
- CDs
- EE and I savings bonds
- Highly rated muni bonds (if you are in a high tax bracket)
