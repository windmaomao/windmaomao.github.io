#Living Trust For Everyone

## Preface

There are four fundamental purposes and advantages of a trust.

- The first is **asset management**. It could be a mistake to give certain beneficiaries a lump sum inheritance. They may be too young to properly manage money on their own, may be mentally incapable of managing it, or may not have enough maturity or good sense to be good money managers. Using a will to leave your assets to your young children may result in money going to someone too young to properly manage it.

- The second benefit this **tax reduction**. While the estate tax now hits fewer people than before due to the high threshold, a trust of one kind or another can either eliminate or greatly reduce estate and inheritance taxes. This purpose is considered by many nonexpert attorneys to be the only reason to have a trust––thus their oft-given yet erroneous advice: You don’t have enough money to need a trust.

- The third advantage is **probate avoidance**, which is a valuable benefit. The big lie put forth by some attorneys and bar associations is that probate is not that expensive and there is no good reason to try to avoid it. The truth is that probate is usually very expensive (because of attorney fees) and is in nearly all cases totally unnecessary if a properly prepared and funded living trust had been prepared. Attorneys who say a trust is not needed are either ignorant of the value of trusts or have a vested interest in seeing probate continue.

- The fourth benefit this for those who wish to **avoid a court-ordered conservatorship** should they become so disabled as to be unable to manage their own affairs. If, for example, a person has dementia, the trust can have provisions that allow a successor trustee (the one who would take control at death) to take over financial management of the trust assets. This helps the person avoid the expense and embarrassment of court supervision.

There is also a grab bag of additional benefits, including 

- privacy (probate is public record; trusts are most often not), 
- low cost (there are no court costs, filing fees, or estate inventory fees on a trust at death), 
- ease of administration, 
- lower likelihood of someone contesting the estate, and 
- elimination of the time delay caused by probate of a will.

## Trusts and Wills Defined

Wills have to be probated.

Trusts don’t. Avoiding probate is a big deal, no matter what your lawyer tells you. And the living trust is the best way to do it.

### What is a Will?

A will is really just a written document telling who gets what part of your stuff at your death, when they get it, and who is in charge of getting the assets to the people who are supposed to get them. You can write your own will in your own handwriting (what lawyers call a holographic will) or it can be typed up, usually by a lawyer, and ceremonially witnessed and/or notarized. You can buy a will online or even get a fill-in-the-blank one at the office supply store. Some states even have a state-promulgated “statutory will,” which is another fill-in-the-blank form. Wills are pretty easy to make and are usually less expensive to create than a trust. The big cost of a will comes later, when the probate fees are counted in.

### What is a Trust?

A trust is also just a written document. It also says who gets what, when they get it, and who is in charge of seeing that that happens. The person in charge is the trustee. The difference is that a trust does not have to go through the probate court.

The reason a trust is not probated is that when a trust is signed, it becomes a legal entity that has the ability to own things. I often analogize it to the hardware store down the street. Smith’s Hardware is a corporation. The corporation owns the building, the inventory, the delivery truck, the hardware bank account, the money in the cash register—all the hardware store assets. The Smiths own the corporation. If they die, the corporation is, in a sense, still alive and will keep selling hardware. New owners come in and take over the business operation.

A trust is similar. In a trust, the trust owners (the “grantors,” “trustors,” or “settlors”) transfer their assets into the name of the trust. Let’s call it “The Smith Trust.” After they sign the trust document, The Smiths then “fund” the trust. In other words they transfer their assets into the trust name. This is done in a few ways, but typically real estate is deeded into the name of the trust by using a quit claim deed. Bank accounts may either be put into the name of The Smith Trust or may pay on death (POD) to the trust (kind of like a beneficiary designation). Life insurance is transferred by naming the trust as the beneficiary. Tax deferred accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s may have the trust as the primary or contingent beneficiary.

The idea is to have The Smith Trust own all the Smiths’ assets. That way, at the death of the Smiths, there is nothing left in their individual names for the probate court to administer. The trust owns their stuff , but they own the trust. They die and the trust still owns their stuff , but the trust document then kicks in. The trust says who takes over at their death to carry out their instructions on who gets what and when.

The great thing is that there is no court order needed for the trustee to take over after the Smiths die. The trustee merely has to show proof that they are dead and show the trust to prove who is the trustee. Then, literally the day after they die, the trustee can begin carrying out their instructions on distributing the trust assets. How the trustee does all this is explained in simple language in the last chapter.

## You Must Have a Trust If

### Minors

If you do not have a trust and die while your children are still young, the inheritance will be given to them in a lump sum when they reach the “age of majority”—age eighteen in most states. In the meantime, the money is held in a court-supervised conservatorship account under the control of the minor’s guardian or conservator. There are three things wrong with this.

### Disabled Beneficiaries

There are millions of disabled people. Disabilities may exist from birth or may be inflicted later on as a result of accident or illness. Mental and physical problems of an heir require that someone else take care of the special needs of the person so that assets are used in the heir’s best interests. The disabled person may be perfectly capable of making financial decisions, but leaving that right to them may mean they are disqualified from certain benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled.


### Spendthrifts

We all know people who just cannot hold onto money. If they have it, they spend it. If they can borrow it, they will spend it. Their credit cards are maxed out. They may have declared bankruptcy, had repossessions, or even been sued for non-payment of bills. These people are spendthrifts and will spend their inheritance very quickly if it is not protected for them. 

### Gay Couples/Unmarried

An unmarried couple, whether gay or not, needs the protection only a trust can offer. Unmarried couples do not have the legal rights afforded to those who are married.

### Blended Families

In the typical family unit today, one or both partners may have been previously married and they may both have had children from those prior marriages. Estate planning is an absolute must in these situations. Otherwise, everything may end up in the hands of the children of the spouse who lives the longest.

- The first consideration is to be sure your current spouse is protected by the trust provisions. 
- The second factor is survival. Without a trust or will, the assets will, in most cases, belong to the surviving spouse. At her death, those assets would by law go to her children.

A trust can contain very flexible provisions to meet your intentions. For example:

1. At the death of one spouse an immediate distribution of certain assets or money is made to that person’s children, with the rest staying in trust for the benefit of the survivor.
2. At the death of one spouse the income from the marital trust assets could be paid out to the survivor as earned, with the remainder at death paid out to all the children of both spouses.
3. The trust could become unchangeable at the death of one spouse to insure that the children of the first spouse to die are not disinherited by the survivor. This means, in effect, that the trust becomes irrevocable at the first death.
4. Most commonly the surviving spouse gets the use and ownership of all the trust assets but cannot change the trust to effectively disinherit the children of the first spouse to die.

Any rules that you think are fair and both agree on can be put into the trust rules and regulations. The above are just a few examples. The point is that if you do not decide now, then state law will decide for you—and you may not like what the law would do.

### Separated Couples or Trusts

Sometimes both spouses don’t agree on what would go into a joint trust and want separate plans funded with their own separate assets. Especially if a couple is separated, each wants to be certain that the trust is not going to be invaded after the death of the first by the survivor. In most states, if both parties agree, the trust assets in separate trusts are not reachable by the survivor except as specifically spelled out in the trust documents. The trust becomes in effect a postnuptial agreement.

### Large Estates

Trusts can eliminate or dramatically reduce estate and inheritance taxes. You might think you do not need to worry about estate tax since the threshold right now is $3.5 million, but keep in mind that the IRS considers all assets taxable. So life insurance, retirement plans, and real estate, as well as traditional investments, are considered taxable. I have seen young parents with very little in the way of liquid assets who have multi-million dollar life insurance policies (which are taxable for estate tax purposes at their deaths) and who ended up paying a huge estate tax bill that could have been avoided with a trust.

This is important because it is a big tax. The tax rate is 37 to 45 percent of everything over the threshold (though the rate is also subject to legislative change). So a $4 million estate could have a tax bill of $200,000.

Large estates can also achieve significant estate and income tax savings using the more sophisticated types of trusts, such as charitable remainder trusts, as well as family limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and other complex estate planning techniques. Consult an estate planning expert to develop a plan for you.

### Small Estates

Even some very small estates benefit from having a trust. You should refer to chapter 9, where I discuss small estates in detail, but in some cases a trust is called for even if non-trust alternatives are available. For example, you may have only your house, a small savings account, and a life insurance policy to leave your children at your death. These could be handled without a trust and without probate by devices such as joint ownership and beneficiary designations.

### Disability

All this is avoided with a trust. The trust has language that defines when a person is to be considered incapacitated, and when that occurs, the alternate or successor trustee immediately steps in and begins managing the assets of the trust owner. When combined with the medical directives and power of attorney that are part of the trust-based estate plan (see chapter 12), there is no need for a court-supervised guardianship and conservatorship. In fact, I have defeated petitions for guardianship in court merely by showing the judge that the proposed ward already had a durable power of attorney as well as a revocable trust with a trustee in place managing the assets.


## A Comparison: Trusts and Wills

### Real Estate in More Than One State

With a trust, all the real estate from every state can be put into one trust ownership using a quit-claim deed and there is no probate in any state. The trustee merely hires an attorney in the companion state to do a deed from the trust to the beneficiaries, or the trustee sells the property in the other state through the trust. No probate and no expenses other than realtor and closing fees.

Huge savings in time, trouble, and money.
