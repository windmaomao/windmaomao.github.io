# The Power of Loss

> "Whatever your risk tolerance or financial goals, one of the greatest challenges to saving and investing is the negative power of losses. A single loss can torpedo a portfolio and, with it, your hopes and dreams of a reliable income and financial security in retirement. " - Book "Slash Your Retirment Risk"

I learned a lot from my failure in my life since they are quite memorable.  Over time, I tend to lean towards them more often than my success, especially when facing new problems or challenges. As I get older, I feel less ashamed of my failure, since I start to see lots of others around me. 

Failure defines your limit and gives you a new perspective on understanding. It makes you cautious when you approach something that might be dangerous to you. And when you realize that you did get burned by it before, it gives you an instant chill of something. 

## Intransferrable

Good or bad, though the parents tend to over-teach their kid not to do something, they actually try to remind themselves. The memory can't be transferred by words, therefore, the kids actually never understand the pain and get super confused sometimes why their parents can be that over-protective. 

Of course, the parents want to protect you and themselves, since if it happened to you, they would actually experience the burn again. And the memory is too much for normal us to handle. By not allowing you to do things, they get a sense of security. 

Most of the failure can't be taught in school. High education tends to be proud on how to reduce your failure rate by teaching you a lot of up-to-date knowledge. Exactly as you figured, they won't be successful in this. His failure can be told as a story, but can't be taught via just words.

Exactly, the kids have to try to get burned once, sounds scary, but if possible, they just have to experience the same thing you had before. Maybe once, if they didn't learn anything from it, they might have to try it again. If nothing can stop them from doing it again and again, maybe it's not a burn for them. This sounds a bit of extreme, unfortunately, this is the only way for them to get the experience. 

## Inevitable

The temptation is always there, if you never get burned from it, it'll be always the temptation for you out there. Sooner or later you'll give it a shot, the question is sooner, or later?

You think you are born in a rich family, you are lucky. Wrong. You think you are born in a happy family, you are lucky, Wrong. It really doesn't matter where you were born. In the category of burn and loss, the god is fair to everyone. You don't inherit anything from your parents, maybe rich or happiness gives you more opportunity, maybe.

The not so funny thing to realize is that no matter what, you will have to experience all aspect of the life as well as the loss part of it. If you can survive the loss and come back strong, you're the winner. If not, you might be the loser. The rest of us just live in between and make a bare living. 

Imagine you have to get to them yourself, alone. It's scary. But it's inevitable. This is life. Nobody can teach you how to live until you have a strong feeling towards living better.

Knowing the inevitability of the loss comes with your age. Burned multiple times with severe burn once or twice, you pretty much get the connection and similarity between them. You don't wait till the world population to blow before doing something, people are naturally adaptive, they'll reduce population long before that.  

## Stop-Loss

>  It's also very counter-intuitive to many of young kids that the long-term success isn't as much about winning big as it is about learning how not to lose. 

Now, the question is that is there any perfect world of getting over the loss and the experience out of it quickly? Don't have to resist the temptation, just taste it and run the heck away from it? Can we do something like that? No consequences? Only fun? 

Of course, the true answer to that is No. But since I refuse to accept that, and try to propose another answer, I'll give you my version of it.

**Lower your experience level**. Yes, like diet, eat less is the cure for everything. 

Basically, if you are shooting for the moon, try something at your front door first. If you are going to spend $50,000 by the end of the year, try $50 today right now. Don't hesitate, do it and experience it today. Especially after you know the magnitude of what you are about to experience, try cut it half, half, half until you can tolerate the scale of the burn that you might possibly get from it.

People might call this timid. I call this do-it-now-insurance policy. If you don't do it now, you lose the opportunity. But if you overcommit, you will 100% get burned heavily ever after. So why not cut in the lower end, try it a little.

Yes, my point of stop-loss isn't going to be effective at all if the total risk you are taking is beyond your comprehension out of your skull onto another dimension. No matter of the future gain that possibly gives you, you might not survive the current pain level.

## Summary

> You need a plan B. Of course there was never plan B. Plan A is all I got. Unfortunately plan A is not good enough! 

This idea of stop-loss isn't original. But I think it's original enough so that parents and kids relationship can improve dramatically. 

Not to be afraid of trying since trying is the most beautiful thing in the world. "Trying is not good enough", leaving that for others' to swollen. To me, trying is living. Afraid of trying is very regrettable.

On the other hand, look for a framework of trying to secure your better chance in the future. If you are dead, you are not able to try anymore. It really sucks if that happens. 

No dying, only trying. Always keep the loss in mind, try little, try today, and try little tomorrow. Gradually you might get chance to try everything without the overwhelming pain. If the pain is not sustainable, try cut it half half half again. And then repeat this process.

Never overdose.
