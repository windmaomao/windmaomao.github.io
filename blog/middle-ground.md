# Middle Ground, old dog gets new tricks

::: abstract
In this article, the author suggest a pattern recognition of revelation of middle grounds between origin and destination. Once identified, we need to claim the middle ground to promote effective usage, therefore speed up the transition into new territory.

## Routine

We do a lot of things without thinking much. Brushing your teeth, going to work, all routines. We are happy about them (or maybe not), and we get used to them. 

One day you need to make a stop for gas before going to work. You stop at an unfamiliar area, you have to make a stop there since you are running out of gas. Alright, that's one day. Next time, you maybe go to the same gas station since you remember it now, or you go to another one which is closer to your work or nicer. Either way after months of commute, I'm sure you prefers one gas station.

This is interesting, because you don't put many thoughts in doing this, but you go to that place often now. What's more interesting is that now since you go to that place often, your next decision maybe revolves around that place. For instance, you'd like to drop your kids to a center there as well. 

## Middle ground

This actually is a bit shocking. You achieved a lot of things without too much forceful thinking, and most important, you actually unconsciously identified a military grade strategic location for helping your achieve your daily goal. 

Subconsciously or not, sooner or later, we realize that we can't achieve everything at one spot. We have to chop bigger thing into small pieces, and we eat them one by one without choking ourselves. 

What's not apparently is, how and when to identify pieces like that, especially the key piece which normally is not "invented" instead emerged. We don't know what we are doing. After we've done it, it still takes times to get the point, oh, that's the key move we made. 

## Revelation 

We can't ignore the pattern of the revelation of these middle ground. It takes time for these ground to emerge from the water, true. The matter of fact is, it does emerge eventually. And along the revelation, we have already utilized it very often, more often than we expected.

If we somehow identify this pattern or this revelation, we need to, this time consciously, establish or claim it as a "future" ground, or simply middle ground. Since strategically or economically, it'll help us more if more people are aware of it.

## New trick

For us, who might be the inventor, we not only need to identify the revelation but also we need to get used to it, make ourselves comfortable first. Sometimes things we create scares the heck of us. The resistance in the core can be huge enough to prevent us from moving forward, or moving forward but eating us along the way.

Inside deep of our heart, we need to realize that the middle ground is practical enough, and I don't have to plan my trip from origin to destination as used to be. I could now commute between new middle ground to destination whenever fits. And if there's really a need, I then make a trip between origin to middle ground to cover the uncovered needs, assuming the frequency of latter is drastically decreased now.
