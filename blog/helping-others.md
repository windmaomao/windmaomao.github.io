> Author tries to experiment with a different approach in helping others via referred as Bad guy model.

The funny part of the business is to help others removing road blockers and landing their feet on the solid ground so that the entire team can move onto the bigger target. 

Like any business, you could approach this problem as a good guy, or bad guy. And lately, I tend to vote the latter approach. This doesn't mean I'd like to be a mean and bad person while offering help. It just that I realized that not many people actually want help from others, independent to what they say or behavior.

If people do not like to be helped, you might feel frustrated after they reject your help in the end. And even worse, they might take your help as a damage or potential threat to them. This is of course not a good way to build the relationship, considering your intention is to actually help. 

## So what should I do?

Just say I'm a bad guy. I really don't care if you need help or not, my intention is to sit in the meeting and walk away after 30 mins of my time. Because I have been asked to sit there (to offer help). Since I don't know if I can help you, I'd rather just sit, not thinking too much about offering help.

Actually, options flow to my mind after I'm taking this approach. Now I don't feel pressured to deliver my point under 30 mins. I can simply sit there starting with a question "How can I help you?" or "Do you have any questions?"

I can imagine there'll be some silence after the question. But I'll continue to pause and wait for the answer since now my goal is to pass that 30 mins. I don't have to watch my watch closely, I simply just need to sit there with my mouth shut. Or raise the question again "How can I help you?"


## Results

You will be surprised by how effectively this approach is. First, they'll start to answer your question in terms of what they want by emphasizing they do need some help. Secondly, they have to think of how to get help in granular level, ex. in which specific area they are actually stuck in their current situation. 

I'll then let them speak for next 20 mins without interrupting them. Why bother, they need to say what they have to say. If they need help, they should be the one who talks the most. Let them talk. My job is to sit, maybe casually I'll listen to a bit, but mostly I should just sit with my mouth shut. 

The next 5 mins, we conclude the meeting, shake hands, and arrange another meeting which might never happen. I walk out of the room with no string attached. Either my help actually means anything to them shouldn't have anything to do with me. I should just carry the same happy mood as before I enter the room, if not better. 

Why is "Bad" guy a bad model here? In the end, I wonder what is the definition of being good in helping others?
