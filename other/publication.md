Mathematical modeling, analysis and simulation are set to play crucial roles in explaining tumor behavior, and the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells over multiple time and spatial scales. This book, the first to integrate state-of-the-art numerical techniques with experimental data, provides an in-depth assessment of tumor cell modeling at multiple scales.

*Three-Dimensional Multispecies Nonlinear Tumor Growth–II: Tumor Invasion and Angiogenesis*

We extend the diffuse interface model developed in Wise et al. (2008) to study nonlinear tumor growth in 3D. Extensions include the tracking of multiple viable cell species populations through a continuum diffuse-interface approach, onset and aging of discrete tumor vessels through angiogenesis, and incorporation of individual cell movement using a hybrid continuum-discrete approach.

*Nonlinear modelling of cancer: bridging the gap between cells and tumours*

Despite major scientific, medical and technological advances over the last few decades, a cure for cancer remains elusive. The disease initiation is complex, and including initiation and avascular growth, onset of hypoxia and acidosis due to accumulation of cells beyond normal physiological conditions, inducement of angiogenesis from the surrounding vasculature, tumour vascularization and further growth, and invasion of surrounding tissue and metastasis.

*Multiparameter Computational Modeling of Tumor Invasion*

Clinical outcome prognostication in oncology is a guiding principle in therapeutic choice. A wealth of qualitative empirical evidence links disease progression with tumor morphology, histopathology, invasion, and associated molecular phenomena. However, the quantitative contribution of each of the known parameters in this progression remains elusive. Mathematical modeling can provide the capability to quantify the connection between variables governing growth, prognosis, and treatment outcome.

*The effects of a diffusion controlled surfactant on a viscous drop injected into a viscous medium*

The effects of a diffusion controlled surfactant on the evolution of a buoyant viscous drop injected into a viscous fluid are studied numerically for the case of finite bulk convection to resolve neck dynamics and detaching drop volumes. When the drop is formed, its interface initially expands. The surfactant adsorbs and depletes a region around the drop. When the drop is sufficiently elongated, a neck begins to form. The surface contracts rapidly above the neck, driving the surface concentration above its equilibrium value.

*The detachment of a viscous drop in a viscous solution in the presence of a soluble surfactant*

When a buoyant viscous drop is injected into a viscous fluid, it evolves to form a distended shape that detaches via the rapid formation and pinching of a neck. The effects of surfactants in altering this process are studied numerically. In the absence of surfactants, surface contraction is fastest in the vicinity of the neck. Thus, when surfactants are present, they accumulate there and alter the ensuing dynamics by reducing the surface tension that drives the contraction.
