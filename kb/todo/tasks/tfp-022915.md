1.  **The question about calculating automatically is missing. I assume you are going to add that later.**

2.  **The instruction to "Add Some Must Haves” should appear only if they did not put enough of those in the original recipe.  It should be hidden until the analyze button is pressed, then stay hidden if they have enough Must Haves in the recipe.**

3.  **The user will have no idea what a Must Have is until they have been using the system for awhile.  Thus, you cannot have a simple search box for the “Add Some Must Haves” function.  Instead, all of the Families that have list 1, 2, B, or 3 items must be displayed when they click on “+New Must Have”.  They can then select one Family to examine the Varieties, then a Variety to examine the Foods.  If they use the system enough, they will know what foods are Must Haves, and they can search by keyword, but we must guide them without requiring them to start with a keyword.**

4.  **The List numbers are for our purposes only.  The user does not know what a “9” is.  Instead of saying “No 9 can be added”  the message should say “Inappropriate ingredient.  Delete or substitute.”**

5.  *When the user clicks on “Find Alternatives”, only acceptable alternatives should be given as choices.  That functionality is missing.  When I put in Cheddar Cheese, for example, Cheese Whiz Lt is currently offered as an alternative, but Cheese Whiz Lt is a list 8 item, so it should not be included as an alternative in any recipe in which the answer to the question about whether the meal will be eaten first thing in the morning or after a workout was “a”, because no List 8 or 9 items should be offered as alternatives if the answer is “a".  If the answer to that same question was “b”, then no items from Lists 5, 7, 8 or 9 should be given as potential substitutes.*

6.  **When “Find Alternatives” is used, if both of the following are true, then the “Find Alternatives” button should disappear:  a) the user selects an acceptable alternative, and b) there are no additional items that require a substitution.  As of now, the “Find Alternatives” button does not disappear until “Analyze” is pressed.**

7.  **After finding alternatives, I added another ingredient, but the system locked up and would not allow me to enter a quantity or units.    When I tried to put units in, it deleted the entire recipe I had been working on.**

8.  Units must include full descriptions, such as “cup, shredded” or “cup, diced”, not merely “cup”.  I understand from Josh that you had a discussion about this yesterday, but I want to include it in my list here so I will remember it.

9.  **Must Haves do not have any Countable Carbs or Countable Proteins, so it is not appropriate to put a counter on the Must Haves for these measures.  What needs to be measured for Must Haves is the number of standard servings of Must Haves are contained in the recipe.**

10.  **In the recipe itself, where “Carbs” and “Proteins” are currently displayed, there also needs to be a “Fats” display.  To the left of those three displays should be the following:  “Countables:”**

11.  **Must Haves are a part of the recipe.  They should NOT have their own separate area away from the recipe.  I put “Strawberries, Raw” into the main recipe, and the counter you have in place counted the carbs and proteins in Strawberries, Raw.  The problem with this is that Strawberries, Raw is an unlimited item from List B.  It is a Must Have.  So the carbs and proteins in Strawberries, Raw should NOT be counted.  Remember, you should NEVER count the carbs, proteins or fats in items from Lists 1, 2, B, 3, 4, or 5.**

12.  **The list is substitutes is supposed to also include items specifically named as substitutes in the “Substitute for:” field.  Those items are not currently being offered.  For example, certain items in the Yogurt family are named as substitutes for Sour Cream, but if I enter Sour Cream, they do not come up as alternatives.**

There are other issues to be resolved, but I think they mostly relate to parts of the specifications that you have not gotten to, so I will stop there.


**1) say Advanced instead of Preference for your New Recipe.  a,b,f,b**
**2) enter “sour cream”, quantity of 1/2, unit can not be selected.** 
**b) popup,                                          Enter ingredient:   Sour cream
                                          Select exact name of ingredient, Big button 
                                          Family Variety and Food Selection**
**c) can not edit ingredient, popup when editing**
3) **substitute, ex. search sour cream and select one, and then go back and substitute need to target sour cream. Save the original search string for finding alternatives**

4) **substitute need to search the saved search string.**

5) **four varieties of alcohol in one family.**

6) **only allow one alcohol in the recipe.**

7) add filter 1/2 for step substitutions

8) **in must-have stage, get rid of New Ingredient button and only leave new Must Have. “”**

9) **another popup for New Must-have,                                       Families - Varieties - Foods in Must-haves**

10) **65.27/12 > 6.29 not less ?**

12) **on 4b step, no CP for 1,2,B,3,S, quantity of must-have is irrelevent.**

13) **search needs to include the variety search as well as the name**

14) **8 oil olive and the fats is not right.**

15) **name of the food instead of List 0 Item**

16) remove CP message and do the same thing we did for CP but this time for fat adjustment.
