3. drag & drop for priority of the task
4. control button will show up when you hover on the task, it'll contain edit, delete, change date, and change priority up buttons, remove edit side panel, so we can have more spaces for buttons
5. total number of tasks for each project is displayed.
5. tasks and log are two different resources which are both associated with project. Log can be associated with a task, but this is just optional. And it'll be two tabs on the same page to switch back/forth in between.
6. each page is for one paticular date range, for day view, we need today, yesterday and tomorrow. For need two switch buttons on the top of the page, one for switch days, and one for switch between resources. Therefore each "page" is targeted for one date range, and one resource type. 
7. each log is associated with created date (fixed), and stop button to calculate the raw hour values, and then helper buttons to adjust it to be book value. Total amount of the hours spent fo the date range and for each project are displayed.
8. reporting needs to display how many hours spent for each project in a calendar weekly view. This is important so that you have a global control of the current status of all projects.
