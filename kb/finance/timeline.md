### Nov

- Concerns about Teslaâ€™s cash position are all the more pertinent because Tesla is due to make a $230 million bond payment in November. A second bond payment of $920 million is looming in March. It can pay that obligation with stock, but only if the share price is above $360. On Friday, the stock closed at $265 after falling 14 percent in a day, following news that the S.E.C. had filed a securities fraud lawsuit against Mr. Musk.

- Stock options have a strike price ($350.02 for Elon Musk), which is the price that Musk will have to pay if he were to vest and exercise any of his options. This means that the options will only have value if the share price goes above $350.02.
