We are aiming to win especially once a while you might be very excited to try to be a winner in some activity. Yes, we want to win, watching my four years old daughter, I can tell you want to be a winner sometimes. If it's climbing stairs faster or getting a promotion, it doesn't matter. We setup a goal, do whatever we can and hope for the best. 

What we don't get trained or born with is how to handle the outcome that wasn't expected by you, mostly negative outcome, for instance, a failure or setback. 

What I found out in the past couple of years is that I didn't get better in improving my skills that much, instead I kinda establish a mindset (or framework) for me to deal with situations that I'm not comfortable with, not good at, or not be able to overcome. 

## Facts

One of the most difficult thing to do is to acknowledge it is a failure. For example, after landing in a field that you have been  miserable with after ten years of hard work. It's a failure since it's not what intended, and your work didn't convert to things that you are hoping for. You get confused, frustrated, or might get into angry management issue. The sooner you call it a failure, the better chance you might get out without dragging it too long there. 

The mindset that help me doing this is that now that I imagine myself in a battle field if I want to win. Winning isn't free lunch, but most importantly it's not 100% gurrenteed. You might do hard work but still ends up in a losing position. The fact is that you might (or let's say in a very high chance to) lose. By even writing this word out, I found myself not comfortable. What I have to put my mind in is that I have more than 50% chance to lose anything that I'm working on. The reason why it's more than 50% is that we tend to do things that interests us which could be unknown to us as well. So for first time gamer, I'll say 99% losing probably is more garunteed.  

What we should do better is to move along with failure. You fail, you should find some comfort zone to set back. For example, go out for lunch, go sleep for a day, hide somewhere. And then you just move on, call it a disaster or failure, talk about it or not talk about it at all. Just move on.

This is something that I find very interesting about human. My daughter can cry for 5mins, and then I yelled at her to move on, and then she moved on. I can see myself (or others) cry about things for hours, days or even months. The thing what we all should learn is to cry  and put a bit effort to move on. I help mystery daughter to get back to her failed building after she cried, and I wish someone could've helped me in some of my past situations. You cried and cried, and then nobody come to help you and then you do something crazier. This is not good. We should just fall back and start all over again. 

We don't have to pretend nothing happened, since it did happen. But it's not big deal, after we cried, we can just accept this is not a good situation, and we move on to see if we can build something again while understanding one of the outcome in the future could be the same if we are not thoughtful. 

The incentive to accept the fact is that there's some accumulative knowledge that you might gain in this situation, and if you can get out of the situation without too much damage, you might actually have better chance in the future.
