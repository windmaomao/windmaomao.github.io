Everybody want to win, but rarely you actually succeed. That makes people want more taste of the winning. People cheer over you, you feel good, or you get a raise, you feel good simply because of the satisfaction of the winning sensation.

I guess not many people study the method of winning, ex. how to do the battle in general and how not to loose it next time quickly. What's worse is that people tend to build more fear than ways of managing risks along this process. 

## Definition

The good news is that I start to believe winning isn't that hard lately. I get this sense from playing iPhone games with other kids, I actually don't know if they're kids, but I'd like to believe that. 

By looking at score everyday and especially after each battle, I realized one thing.  You go win this battle and loose next battle, and win more this week and loose more next week. The overall winning sense is average wise ad-hoc number. It could be increasing if you are gradually getting better of handling battle ground. 

I instead start to establish way defining this success status, simply because the score is changing every minute. More importantly you shouldn't cry over yourself if you are not actually loosing the entire game. What is the game ? You might wonder.

You think I'll tell you the definition of the winning, unfortunately I can't. As any life event, we're human, we just can't define things very clearly, especially when the span of the event is more than month. Just look at stock market if you don't believe me, people simply have no idea what they are doing. But like playing game 'Go', you do not necessarily need to know the definition precisely, but you do need a good estimation and if you are good enough, you should calculate this odds.  

## Odds

So my friend, one thing that we really should do is coming up a method or ways  to measure if you are going to succeed or not, and what are your odds. Of course it's difficult when the definition isn't clear yet, but while you are looking for measurement, I believe it'll help tremendously narrow down your ambition and reserve resources on things that you have better chance winning. 

Of course, real life isn't as simple as playing Go against one player. It also carries a lot of benefits. For instance, not many people will continue doing what they are doing when things are falling apart like no tomorrow, they'll do couple of variations.

### Stop doing it

Stop doing what you are doing does not equal to failure, there's no shame to stop you from killing yourself. As I mentioned, depending on the span of life that you use to measure your success, you might get different answers. But one thing is for sure, you have the right to stop things. What you really shouldn't do is to continue of this pattern of trying to kill yourself and preventing it afterwards. Recognize your pattern of doing things helps a lot. Because that's your first step in establish your unique way of measuring success odds. Every one is special, but at same time, not that special. 

### Ask help

Lots of people are friendly, they tends to seek help when they find it's beyond their capability to nail certain things, so they ask around so that they can stay in track to pursue what they are doing. They are no quitter, but also they asks help from other people. Of course depending on how you think of it, you might feel shameful when this happens, but as before, during longer span of life, it should just average out your score. You make friends along the way, life can't be better than that. You can't depend on somebody forever, after you find other suggested way, you need to decide if you are going to quit or pursue with that information. Lots of decision making. 

### Just nail it

Well last but not least, there's always brutal force for things to happen or not eventually made it if brutal force is applied. IMHO, this is the last resort, since it doesn't increase your odds of winning, instead it'll force you to play luck. Think of this as just blindly gamble on chip table, your odds of winning is normally less than what you think. Keep learning from others and growing yourself, and measuring if things are going well, will actually keep you doing good without any brutal force. People normally use forces when they believe nothing else is going to work, but this is simply not true statement, we need to train ourself deliberately understanding this fact. Because you might loose more than what you have. This is the #1 no no in winning. Never go all in.

## Winning

If you are easy to work with, I'd say you'd find the first two options useful enough. The point is not betting on what action you are taking at that particular moment, instead, you should keep a habit of refining your measurement of success odds at all times. It doesn't have to be accurate, but you shouldn't block your opportunities of doing that once a while. Your action is simply the natural reflection of your measurement. Better the measurement, higher the odds of winning eventually.

Life is not just about winning. But I don't know about you, I simply like winning all the time, it just make me feel alive. I really believe with this methodology in mind, it'll be very hard for any of us loose the entire battle and not be able to taste some sense of winning during our life span. Email me if you do.
