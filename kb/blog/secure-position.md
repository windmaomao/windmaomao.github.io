The following are princinples that I have been gathered during my trading experience and I'm hoping to continue accumulate and refine these strategy so that they can be applied in general to guide personal life development towards winning. 

### Secure a position

In order to win, the first thing is to secure a position. The definition of securing a position is to hold the position without closing for relatively long period of time, for instance, six month. This is the first step towards winning. If you can't secure a position, you should close it asap so that you can preserve majority of your money, time and opportunity. 

All discussion below will be based on the measure of the resources spent, ex. money, time, and opportunity cost. Because if we are just talking about winning without cost, majority of the effort is ok to consider. Also we are not talking about winning while preseving your ego  either. If you insist, you can adjust the definition of the resources, ex. adding a bit ego to the resources. We're all human in the end.

#### Bet small

Now we put the cost as the baseline, I'll start with lowering your expecation and the stake.

If you are betting your life on winning anything, the chance you can survive from it is actually slim since any error is exatradated to swing you left and right big time. This is why I believe betting life on anything is normally not a good idea for personal development.

Instead bet small, small enough that you can keep doing it, small enough you laugh about it all the time, small enough you welcome and learn most from it. Small enough that you can be in the game. There's no one-for-all-size for small, it's relativity. 

The irony is that It's not uncommon to see we increase the stake when facing uncomfortable situations. Statistically speaking,  we go low, high, sideway, or not going anywhere. 

Holding your position in the game is very important, since not being able to securing it means losing all the resources spent already. It's such a wastful action that you should try as hard as possible to prevent that. In terms of investment, 100% of loss is totally unacceptable. of course, our aim is not to even lose 90% of it, but let's be humble, take one step back, please try not to get a knock out at the first place.

When you are extremely ambitious about something, you put more than what you should. You get a knock out very quickly, yes you get knocked out. Please don't be 100% stupid. Learn the statistics in how not to get a 100% knocked out. Go easy, if you are not ready, don't get inside the ring. If you get there, make sure it's not a heavy weight game. Don't attempt suicide. I know we were all there before, please try hard not to do that again. 

#### Hold

Let's say I bet small, and then what? Ok, just hold, see if you can hold there. If you didn't notice it already, betting small helps you big time already in holding. Now you have to do your job. 

Believe it or not, It might be against human natual to hold position for some time. A new-born doesn't learn this until he hits age 2-3, or sometimes never for some people. We enjoy doing new things that is  some variation of the old thing. Not doing something is, by default,hard.

The vivid oppsite of holding a position is to leave the position right afterwards. Wow, this is the most bizzare human flaw in our logic. To be honst, your landing of the position only sets your return to effort ratio to be the lowest. I know you never think of that. We like fun stuff, get there, brag about it, and see if we can get somewhere else now. This is us. You might have a fun life, but in the end, you won't have any return. I won't regrate saying that, let me say it again. If you move on without securing your position, you won't have any return. 

> The gain, somehow, is measured by duration of holding after securing. Not neccesarily in a linear way, but no holding guarantees zero gain. 

Here I'm asking you to hold your position a bit longer than you can sustain, and then close it willingly. In a zero sum game, if everyone closes before you, you absolutely don't need to close, go figure. If you close a bit later, statistically you should be able to find a better position (to close). This is true in a buying case, if you can hold a bit longer to open the buying position, you should land a better decision to either continue the buying or wait till next time. This extra time is important in beating the consensus simply attributing to more information available to you.

The new information doesn't nessarily favor you. If you have a losing hand, you might lose more with this delay. This is exactly the rational you want to close ASAP. But you don't know what is the right definition of ASAP. My personal experience is that closing in next second can carry an overwhelming cost that first wipes out your current gain and secondly makes the future gain almost impossible. 

In order not to regret about the closing under emotion, let's try enduring the suffering a bit, extend it a bit longer than what normally we can. The reason is to see if we can take the losing into the equation and spot the next possible better position along the way so that we can fully understand the losing position, learn something about it and hopefully minimize it.

> Taking one step back, If you were not bothered by the discomfort, you could be in a (very) good mood overall. 

One way to beat a game is to taking multiple games and see  if you can win another one when losing this one with a managed lose. This is not a easy but most of time working approach, because you add more to the equation to hopefully change the overall outcome. Statistically, unless you are extremely doomed, you shouldn't be losing on all grounds at the same time. Well if that happens, I'm sure you can find another ground to hold by lowering your expectations.  

In order to get back to the game in the future, you need to hold a bit longer than others. In other way, your current discomfort can trade your potential gain (or less loss) later if you can be a bit more patient to endure your current pain while looking for solutions :)
