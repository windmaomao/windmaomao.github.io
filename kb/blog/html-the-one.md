Fifteen years ago, I was about to graduate from college and I was asked / encouraged / or just willing to make a website for the classroom. I didn't know Facebook at that time. Maybe Facebook hasn't been invented yet, maybe I'm not a social person, never a fan of Facebook or any social media group. Don't really understand how a lot of people can have fun at the same time. I start to understand myself better by watching the show "Mr Robot" lately. I really don't need to connect with this character, because it's scary to watch yourself on the other side of the screen. No shit. 

That's just me. But I love HTML for whatever reason I can not describe. It's like another way to differentiate yourself from your parents' generation. They're fan of computers, even my grandpa is fan of computer before he passed away. So I have to be fan of something that they're scared about. And since I'm not a fan of social media, I hope my baby girl will scare me by just gluing her thumbs on her phone when she grows up. And I will be really pissed and scared at the same time. I think i won't be scared, but will be really pissed. 

New generation is always scary. I literally can not catch up with the speed on writing emails or catching up with news, or just learning there's a new framework coming out which I never heard of and apparently a lot of big companies has been using them for a while. A while may be a month, but it all sounds like it has been years and years of development. 

That really sucks. But I still love HTML. And for whatever reason I start to see the new age has just began. It might have something to do with the phones, might have something to do with NodeJS, might have something to do with Google or not Apple. But apparently HTML is becoming the #1 language of the universe very soon. Maybe lots of people are already believing that, I'm a bit slow, I actually don't see this coming last year when majority of large applications are still built with C#, Java, and Object C on desktop. I hate most of the languages, to be honest, I never seriously sticked with one of them, and I never liked Javascript this much until now.  

Language is like a tool, I can speak two languages, and I don't have to like them. They're just tools, I actually hate a bit of all languages, because you have to spend time practicing them, otherwise you just forget and will never pick them up back again. So when you like a language, you better talk with it every day. I have to remind myself to speak Chinese with my baby girl, otherwise that's another thing which will scare or piss me when she grows up. 

So why HTML ? I have no clue, I guess like the stock, you just need some faith, and then watch it grow, and then one day, you can just see you win. This is like HTML. It's an investment which takes so long and so much effort and so much bumpy road. And to be honest, most of my friends and parents are not appreciating this thing. They just thought this is a new/old thing, like Apple.  I don't know, everything seems to me as an investment these days. Maybe I'm getting old, I never heard this word when I was a kid. You just do it back then, and it's not an investment.

Whatever, two years ago, I believe NodeJS will be the future, and for some reason, today I believe HTML will be the future of our generation, although without Javascript it'll be still an empty shell.

If you don't believe me, just take a look on Chrome App or Electron App. Whoever created HTML at the first place probably won't see this coming, maybe he's very smart, he's the inventor. But shit me, I could never imagined this day, I still remember the old day when people paid me $50 for a HTML page. No kidding, I did it anyway. Well, no kidding, when you look back, you really have to give some credits on following your dream, zigzag, zigzag, you suffer while trying to make a living, and then suddenly you realize it's a dream coming true. 

So in short, HTML is coming, and you need to have reasonable amount of faith on your hobby.
