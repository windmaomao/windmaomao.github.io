Natural way of thinking in programming



I started programming since grade five. I thought programming was pretty kool, pretty abstract and pretty whatever I could do at that time. However I never thought programming is human way of expressing myself, since the learning requires a bit machine way of thinking.  It made me more like machine afterwards, no doubt about that. 



The world had changed dramatically after that, so as the computational power. Machine seemed to catch up the speed, as well as the complexity of the world that it tries to model. 



Therefore the programming took different turn couple of years ago. 



Now we can think the way we think. If it's about logic, we can program as a deep thinker, who can derive a idea based on an assumption of an idea, which could be vague.  



We spend more time on drafting function interface, and how to abstract that ideas using function as the thinking process unit. Each process unit is drafted by a unique thinker who experienced that part of the idea better than other thinkers. This matrix of idea put together becomes the knowledge. 



There's nothing more natural than that in thinking, or let us say, in thinking properly again when it comes to the programming.
