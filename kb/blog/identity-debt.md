# Identify Drag

This morning when I was driving to work, I was thinking about my grandpa pass away. And he is on my mom side, and I wasn't very close to him, especially after I grew up. Since all the memories were coming back, I had a strange realization for my parents.

Both of my grandpa worked for very high rank back in the government, but none of their children are. Nobody in my family actually talked about this, so my guts feeling is that my grandpa were very OK that their children weren't pursuing the same career path. They moved on.

However this created some disconnection for their children between what they want to achieve against what they think should achieve, especially after they grew up. I looked to all my aunts and uncles, including my parents, lots of them are very successful in what they are doing, but most of them are pure in pursing their "new" career. 

It's difficult to explain this disconnection, like a zombie, they all stuck in the middle plane subconsciously, between their current career status and their parents/family status. 

To me, this is like a drag, very much like a debt.

## Identity

This brings me to a word "Identity". Everyone has an identity, you have a name, a face, an education and a history. You might be proud of yourself, at the same time, you can't change the identity any bit. You are born into this context, and your life is afterwards in it forever. Time only gives it more depth gradually. 

In one of my dream, I took an air plane, and on the gate, I gave my fake passport which got strange face in it.  I got away as another person. And then I waved at the crowd. Suddenly I'm free as a normal person, at the airport. 

Subconsciously you work for your family, your family status quo, believe it or not. Your career might be million times different than what your parents did, but somehow you are still familiar with what they did and tempted or obligated to do what they did, even this sounds so strange and wrong to you. 

I guess, this explains why people don't change that often, down to the bottom, you can't change your family. Some of us might fight against it, and some of us might give up. Some might just let it go. But doesn't matter what you do, your identify is with you, wherever you go. It's a merit, but it's also a drag as well, more like a debt. It could help you but it could also sink you.

## Change

If this is all true, that explains why I can't be pure to my own thing. I'm doing my own thing, but I always felt that I'm not most of time. I'm doing it to prove myself, but I'm also defending myself all the time. This is very different to what I really want and you can see why it's difficult. I like to be born with my thing, not just doing it. This is the status quo I want to achieve for myself. 

Now my dream comes back, face lift. What if I can just for a second pretend I wasn't born in my family, I got new name, got new education, got new job, got new history that I'm building. At the airport, I was a new person, with a name nobody cares, because in my new world, I'm nobody, I become a person that is so normal to be ignored as an individual who's just doing his natural thing, waving at the crowd.

The point is not that I want to be someone that is important. The point is that I want to be someone that can be ignored as something taken for granted by everyone else. So that I can be free and pure to my own thing.

In that world, I can be pure to yourself. 'Cause, I'm normal again.
