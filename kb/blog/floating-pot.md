# Floating Pot, no string attached

This is probably the bizarre thing ever happened to me. I'm actually thinking about writing a book about things happening around me. 

I kept talking to friends and joking that they should write a book about it. But it seems never occurred to me that maybe I should just go ahead and write about it. They are saying it might be an "Office space" sequel two, but honestly speaking, I never watched office space, nor am I interested in seeing it. The reason I want to write about it is mainly because instead of talking about it every day, I should save some energy and made them on a piece of paper so that others (ex. me) in the future can review them retrospectively. 

You'll see a lot of "retrospect" from now on, as you will see, I like to retrospect, and replay things a bit and see if I can spot things that I missed. This actually becomes a problem for me in this company, since most of the things I really want to miss them. They are funny, but if I retrospectively think about them, I found them extremely annoying. I can't really complain these to my wife, she's not interested, also she found it annoying that I don't think these things "natural". Oh yeah, I don't found them "natural" at all. 

I'm an immigrant and currently at the last stage of committing myself as an American citizen. It's 2017, it takes some effort for me to understand the situation, and try best to come up a way to continue my ancestor's path, whatever that is. Of course, this is a side topic.

The main topic is that I found this company, and they accepted me very quickly. I was shocked that this company is so big considering all the company that I worked before has less than 5 people including CEO. I appreciated for a while that the company accepted me after a couple of interviews. The only one which I still remember was a conversation with my two bosses. Actually, they turned out to be the few of humans that I got along the way. They really liked me, and in return, I did well to them in next five years. Well, that's funny, if you ask me, maybe that's the reason I did my contribution. We normally do good to people that respect or play fair with us, don't we?


#### Chapter 1
As far as I remember, the company is pretty big, they had their up and downs in the previous decade, mostly down, but it is still pretty big. The building I'm in has open kitchen styles, you are supposed to see everyone, facebook style. In reality, I found it comfortable, you actually can't see anyone in next row due to two monitors in front of you, and most of the time, nobody pays attention to you. Did I mention it's a big company? "I am just a tech." 

I had my desk, really close to a private bathroom, really close, but not right next to it. This is the really awesome feature, I can come to the office, code, take a dump, and come back to continue coding without much distraction. My life is pretty much about coding, although most of what I wrote in the past wasn't worth to brag about, but honestly speaking, I like my job, much better than the one my ancestor wanted me to do. That's why I quit from my previous career, and took an 180 degrees turn 6 years ago and ended in this not-new-enough cutting edge industry, IT industry. There are some subtleties between IT and software industry, but let me first put this difference aside, since I thought I was hired as a programmer. 

One guy sitting in front of me, a people person, introduced me to the entire floor, very nice introduction. I can't remember anyone's name or face, or any conversation. Except I got overwhelmed that I joined a big family, mostly, faces from my country. I'm not really used to the big family, I just never had chances. All I was doing in my previous life is studying, preparing to come to the US, and studying, and dreaming of coming to the US, and going back to study. I was lucky, actually, I made it. Well, that was a long story how I made it, but let's pretend it's pretty straightforward, if you dream of it, you'll get it someday. Let's not destroy any young soul. 

This people's person turned out to be the least relevant to my office life, even though he's right in front of me. But he turned out to have very little interest at me, and same from here. So we just kept that way. Ironically the distance doesn't speak much about the impact in some cases.

#### Line Manager

Then I met with my line manager, Robert. It took me a while to understand what is a line manager. The line manager is someone you do report to, but maybe only once a year, but he can have little with your project or daily activity.
