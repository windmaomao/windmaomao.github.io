# Sustainable Prototyping

I really enjoy prototyping, although you can't find a web design job for protoyping only, I have been managing to get quite a bit prototyping work done throughout the year both from my professional work and personal time. 

Yes, I'm lucky.

## Prototype vs Production

For people doing protoyping, I believe it's driven by some sort of ambition to get the picture out of your mind quickly. And you'd like to have a free flow of your idea onto piece of paper. It's dirty and quick, but get to the point. Don't get me wrong, it can be quite beatiful sometime. 

One thing that in common is that most of my protoping takes less than two weeks, either it get accepted or rejected, I move on to other things afterwards.

Comparing the prototype and some production quality product, the product in the market is quite appealing to eyeball and easy to use, and most importly the user data is stored forever. That is why we call them production.

Over very long time, I'm subconcisously looking for a way to sync between the prototype and the production. And in the end, I give up. Not because it's not doable.  

I simply found that these are two different things. The product is always inspiring to bring the essense out quickly, that might be the reason why you get into it in the first place.
