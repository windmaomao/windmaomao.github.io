## Deutsche Bank

UI / AngularJS Architect

09/16/2015 - 

Serves *UI* and *AngularJS* architect in Market Clearing domain for 45+ banking applications. Due to their cost-effective natural as well as long term strategic maintenance advantage, *modular design and reusable component* are my essential toolsets in architecting UI element, and data services.

I created for Deutsche Bank Market Clearing branding header, menu, fly-in menu, form as well as dark and light theme switch. I also made these components pluggable with no more than 10 lines of code for other developers to reuse them in their JSP or Angular native applications. I also designed swappable authorization services for components to be aware of the domain server while obtaining user permissions and settings.
