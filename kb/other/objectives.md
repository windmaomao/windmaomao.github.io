1. [QP] [1st 2015] **Narrow the focus of the QPLOT website to products, ex. Knowledgebase. Transition back from the contractor to Product and Service, and try to align the company with the needs of small companies. This refers to the model, one giant, one medium, one small, one trivle client. Although giant company can give large revenu, but there might be only one and the risk is that once it's gone, you're fried. The opportunity cost to have that giant is also high. To balance this out, more medium or even small size company should come to play. By building product, you can transition to even tiny size personel. And eventually 10000 user base is a bit scary. NOTE: it's hard to keep medium and giant at the same time, maybe all medium is the way to go. Things are in common about small business is a) one or two share holder, medium to old age b) running business which focus on innovative business development c) eager to blend in new technology into their business d) hard to retain talents due to their business natural**
