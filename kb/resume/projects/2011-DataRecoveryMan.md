### DataRecoveryMan, Apr 2011 - Dec 2011
UI Developer

Helped [DataRecoveryMan.com](DataRecoveryMan.com) build an application for managing inventories of hard drive repair order, tracking order status and uploading order invoice. I was responsible for gathering the business requirement, prototyping design from business workflow and working with an offshore *PHP* developer to deliver the application.
