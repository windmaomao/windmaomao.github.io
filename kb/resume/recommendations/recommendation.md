### 2020

Fang has a very good first half of 2020. OBI squad has adopted SCRUM delivery model with 2 week sprints. The squad follows all the SCRUM rituals like daily stand up, sprint planning, sprint retro, dev sync ups very diligently. Practicing these rituals along with continuous delivery every 2 weeks does require lot of close coordination and collaboration among all the squad members and co-location helps in facilitating the process. However in case of OBI, co-location of product squad became challenging due to onset of pandemic which required all team members to work remotely and there was great possibility that this will affect team productivity ultimately impacting project timelines. To my surprise, after initial hiccup team adjusted to the new working conditions very well. Fang played tremendous role in ensuring that Dev squad continues to have common shared vision of the product through constant communication and regular touch points. Fang has been responsible for architecting UI of OBI and has been very good at mentoring junior developers like Zulmy and Miguel to make substantial contributions to overall UI of OBI. Off late Fang has voluntary come forward to create/setup test framework for automated regression test pack. This is highly commendable and does exhibit his willingness to work for greater good of the team. In the coming months, I would like Fang to focus on integrating Centaurus (Brandnet Compliant UI Core Component library) with OBI and also enriching it with new components (including migration of OBI components into Centaurus library). Fang is doing a good job leading the tech team and at times it is necessary to make decisions but i would like him to practice consensus based decision making so that decisions are backed up all members of the squad. Overall Fang continues to show progress and growth and i wish him continued success for remainder of 2020.

Fang has exhibited excellent sense of accountability and meritocracy which is very evident from the completion of work (ex UI architecture, Forms etc) in timely manner. He is highly client focused and comes up with solutions and ideas that are valuable. While he is good at collaboration there is room for improvement especially when it comes to consensus based decision making.

### 2017

Fang has done an outstanding job delivering the framework and controls that now make up the Global Console and partnering with other project teams to ensure its adoption. He has also engaged well with the Autobahn team to align his GUI framework with their styles and to help shape the technical architecture of their next generation Web ADK. If Fang can work on articulating the vision for a re-usable framework in line with these standards (and upgraded to Angular 4) he will be in great position to have an even wider impact with other teams across Equities this next year."

Fang continues to build his MC profile globally and is well respected across his peers group and stakeholders. Fang has helped build complex business solutions that can sustain a high level of performance in CE where he has proven himself. He should be considered for promotion in the next round."

### 2016

Fang has been very professional in his approach working with various stakeholders globally. Overall Fang has had a very good year with MC and 2016 he is an solid member of the MC CE UI development team. Fang has settled in very well with the team and has had a postivive influence on UI dev across group working with UI lead in NY. Fang has been very professional in his approach working with various stakeholders and keep the bar high in terms of quality and delivery. Team has seen improvements with him mentoring joiner and senior UI devs from various backgrounds."

### 2015

Have been very happy with Fang's work and performance in the few months that we've worked together. This is Fang's first job in a large corporate environment and in securities process so while there's a lot for him to learn, he's eager and willing so see good things for him in the future. I intend to assign new technologies, new business problems to Fang to keep him growing. He's got good potential and I hope he will remain flexible."

Fang is fairly new to the organization, joining us in August. He has been a strong communicator and very responsive on all communications and requests. He has been learning about our applications and technologies and built a new UI for dbVals, and already has several idea and changes he has implemented. He is an active participant in the UX working group. I am looking forward to seeing how Fang grows and progresses within the CE team over 2016."

We had Fang come in and help us get an admin portal up and running so we could more easily manage our system. He immediately started contributing and he obviously knew what he was doing when it came to *AngularJs*. He also helped us ==improve our existing libraries== and wasn't afraid to give us pointers on how they could be improved -- a very good quality in a programmer. He has given us a very good foundation to build our application on going forward and we appreciate his hard work.

I found Fang Jin on-line; I was looking for a web developer to help me launch a newer version of my website. I arranged a meeting with Fang and found him to be very knowledgeable and helpful. It was important to me that I could participate, going forward, in continued web improvements. After discussions with Fang, he convinced me of an alternative development strategy and now, in hind-site, that was absolutely the right call. Fang has a **deep understand of web development and execution** and was a quick study when it came time to integrate another vendor's application. In just a matter of weeks, I was up and running with my new site. Great communication and solid integrity.

Fang is an excellence back-end developer with front-end development skills. He is always willing to learn and take on new technologies. He is very easy to work with and dedicated. While working with Fang I noticed that he was interested in **using new technologies to make development faster and easier for the whole team**. Fang is a leader in identifying road blocks in the development process and usability. He diligently looks for solutions and will create terrific documentation to lead forward with a new project/concept that includes new coding methods/standards to make the development process easier for the whole team. Fang would develop prototypes of concepts for charts for outputting and organizing data in a creative way based on Designs. I would highly recommend working with Fang in the future.

Fang volunteered for the International Center for Disaster Recovery during September and October 2014. He helped us begin to **move our proof of concept for RecoveryHub (using *Drupal* Commons 3.0) toward a robust, deployable solution.** Fang created a framework for us using Drupal's Features that will allow us to modify and enhance our site in the future more easily. He quickly learned technologies that we were using such as Apache Solr. One of the things that we appreciated about Fang is that he always took a "big picture" view of our project and advised us on different options to take, rather than simply proceed without asking questions. He thoroughly explained the pros and cons of each option, making him a trusted team member and adviser. Fang will be well suited for future senior architect or developer roles.

At Duke, I worked with Fang on a couple of projects. During each project, not only did he demonstrate exceptional knowledge of the tools at hand, but he also exhibited a **deep understanding of the requirements and challenges that he faced**. He is incredibly talented when it comes to any aspect of a project: interpreting the needs of the client; suggesting ideas for implementation; providing quick turnaround time; etc... Fang also showed great excitement and interest for technology outside the scope of the project. He was always eager to show off or talk about some new demo he had been working on in his spare time. I always looked forward to hearing him talk about his newest interest. Fang is very personable and quite knowledgeable on all aspects of technology, whether it be front-end design, programming or server configuration/setup. It was a real pleasure working with him.

Fang is one of the most talented software developer / architecture individual I have ever met. His ability to take vague customer requirements and turn them into a fantastic software solution never ceased to amaze me. He continually went above and beyond to **solve complex problems with very thoughtful, simple, and robust solutions**. His ability to quickly comprehend issues, formulate a plan, and execute a solution are one of the best I've every seen! I would recommend Fang for any organization looking for Drupal and/or general programming assistance!
