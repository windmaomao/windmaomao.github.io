Recommendation 
=

I worked scott for two projects with Scott being the manager of the project. I have to say his experience on software development is the #1 factor make him stand out of the crowd. 

He's calm in fast-pace projects, and understands everyone's role and especially let everyone play at their strong side instead of let them bump into each other. His coordination in management made sure the project is on schedule and aligns with the expectation with shareholders. Thoughout all my projects in the past, I haven't seen many project managers achieved that.  

He's also not just a good developer,  he'll pickup the weak point of the team and put himself in and fill that role just so that the project can move quickly ahead. He's especially considerate in picking things that no-one has clue with and just roll with it and nail it in the end. This made huge impact for projects which happen to require certain technology or tools but not available at that time. This is something that is not common for project manager either.

In short, I highly recommend the leadership of Scott in managing web development projects due to his excellence of skills and patience of working styles.
