Exploiting the Distortion with Misesian Tools 

We ask ourselves: 

- How are we exposed to malinvestment? Are we, for instance, investing in what is most manipulated by, whose profitability is most dependent upon, artificially low interest rates? 
- Beyond avoiding it, can we perhaps even benefit from it?

If this book achieves nothing else, it would more than hit its mark if readers came away with greater awareness of such distortions in the economy and the markets, which magnify the human tendency toward the direct reward of _li_, and acquired a deeper appreciation for the arduous path of _shi_. The thought process here is what matters most; it is the real takeaway, a prescription for all investors, as it culminates the overarching theme of this book: **the roundabout of The Dao of Capital as the circuitous means toward the ends of productive capital investment, despite our biology and a system rigged against it**.

### Homeostatis En Force

Since the Misesian Stationarity index can reach a lofty level (meaning the economy can persistently deviate from stationarity) only because of monetary distortion, we should expect a very high MS index to act as a prelude to a price of title to existing capital (the stock market, the numerator in the MS index) that is unsustainably high; this follows our expectation that the replacement value of that capital (the denominator in the MS index) will be unresponsive, as further new investment is thwarted by the distortion. Savers and investors, dissatisfied with artificially low interest rates that don’t reflect their actual time preferences, placate themselves by eking out yield and otherwise chasing immediate returns (which are themselves given a boost from higher immediate consumption and lower savings from artificially lower rates). They quickly devour the immediate marshmallow in front of them, scoffing at the potential rewards for waiting. The lower rates make otherwise marginal investment schemes look good, and otherwise marginal existing capital (having marginal returns) look suddenly profitable, resulting in a scramble to own it and resulting in persistent market maladjustments. The system becomes starved of capital for roundabout production, as ==capital is trapped in the present—consuming itself==, as it were—and thus there are insufficient resources to support the ongoing illusion of economic progress.

It only stands to reason that the stock market should inevitably fall (and fall in a violent, concentrated manner) as investors are routed into immediate liquidation altogether; existing capital is priced too high relative to its ultimate profitability, and all the monetary delusions of grandeur are simultaneously revealed in a burst of highly correlated entrepreneurial error.

### Witness to the Distortion

![Misesian Stationarity Index & Tobin's Equity Q ratio](https://s3.amazonaws.com/qp-review/dao-capital-9-1.jpg)

Now for some housekeeping: As discussed in Chapter 7, the MS index is very well represented by what is known as the (Tobin’s) Equity Q ratio—total U.S. corporate equity divided by total U.S. corporate net worth—which is readily available online through numerous sources, and easily computable using Federal Reserve Flow of Funds balance sheet data (and it is the height of irony that the very institution at the root of the distortion, the recognition of which is the point of the MS index, provides the data necessary to calculate it).

The next and most pertinent question: What is the real effect of this distortion on the numerator (the aggregate land expectation value if this were taking place in our Nibelungenland, and the aggregate stock market capitalization in our real economy)? Let’s start by examining **the total excess returns (the return, including dividends, in excess of the one-year “risk free” treasury rate) of the S&P Composite Index** (the biggest, most closely watched, and most heavily traded and well recorded capitalization-weighted U.S. stock index, a very good proxy for the total corporate equity of the MS index) following different regimes of monetary distortion since the turn of the twentieth century.

Based on what we now know, we would expect to see an inverse relationship: When the MS index is low, the subsequent average stock return should be high; when the MS index is high, the subsequent average return should be low. 

![S&P Composite Excess Total 1-Year Returns 1901–2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/qp-review/dao-capital-9-2.jpg)

What’s driving these return differentials? Do stocks merely drift up at steeper rates under low MS index levels than under high ones, or is there something else going on? Of course we would expect to see the indications of severe malinvestment liquidation driving these results, meaning severe subsequent stock market losses (and we’ll look at the concentration or speed of such losses a bit later).

In the following test I use S&P Composite Index “drawdowns”—or the amount by which our S&P returns cumulatively turn negative during any three-year window before rising again—as a measurement of stock market losses. In bucketing these drawdowns based on the MS index at the start of each period, just as I did in Figure 9.2, we start to uncover the market’s dynamics.

In Figure 9.3, the lowest dark bar indicates the 20th percentile drawdown, or the realized drawdown at which 20 percent of all the data in the bucket are lower, and the light bar above the dark bar is the 50th percentile—also called the “median”—drawdown, or the realized drawdown at which half of all the data in the bucket are lower. 

![Higher Expected Drawdowns with Higher MS Indices 1901–2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/qp-review/dao-capital-9-3.jpg)

What a financially distorted world tells us is that the market, just like the overgrown forest, carries within it the seeds of its destructive correction; **thus the inevitable bust that follows the boom is not (or at least should not be) an unexpected event**. This is a very important realization, something of a death blow to the concept of systemic risk, and which will become the backbone of the Austrian Investing I rationale (and without which we would be left as mere victims of the distorted market and seemingly random shocks).

### An Initial Misesian Investment Strategy

 A quick and dirty scan of the MS index chart (Figure 9.1) tells us that, say, a reading of 1.6 and, say, of 0.7 were historically generally high and low levels—so likely good places to sell and buy stocks, respectively. And when we’ve sold out of our stocks, we buy one-month treasury bills and roll them each month until we buy back into the stock market. How would that have done? (There is a good deal of ex post information in this strategy, because we didn’t know what constituted a good MS index level at which to sell or buy until it was all over, of course. However, it turns out—not surprisingly—that’s not a concern: If I instead start my test after, say, 1925—the first complete cycle—rather than 1901, and use only the information known at the time from then on, I get equivalent results. No cheating.)

 ![Total Compound Annual Returns 1901–2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/qp-review/dao-capital-9-4.jpg)

 **The Misesian strategy outperforms the stock market by more than two percentage points per year. Think about what this shows. A basic “toy” strategy (with an “alpha” t-score of well over 4) based solely on an easily calculatable and logical measure of market distortion beats not only the average professional stock picker (who consistently underperforms the S&P), but also the (highly survivorship-biased) average hedge fund manager (such as from the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index)—and with far less fanfare and risk.** (And, for the record, while others have made attempts at Austrian market indicators of all sorts, none to my knowledge has either had these results nor avoided the lures of arbitrary ex post fitting and spurious relationships.)

 The properties of the MS index offer a logical, straightforward, and highly pragmatic guide that most people can follow and understand, acting as a very simple gauge to judge one’s investment theses. And yet it still seems to elude most people—after all, very few people, including professionals, get these kinds of investing results over time. The reason, as you’ve probably deduced by now, is that these returns are only realized in an exceedingly roundabout way; the detour beats the direct route. That is, **it takes the Misesian strategy’s average underperformance duration and magnitude of almost three years and 9 percent annualized to gain the advantages of investing for its eventual 2 percent cumulative outperformance**. (Just imagine still waiting today after two decades to reenter the once-again booming stock market.) It painfully sacrifices immediate profits (as markets become more and more inflated by artificially low rates) most of the time for a tremendous eventual advantage (in buying after they inevitably deflate). It is investing, weiqi-style.

 > In the immediate-marshmallow world of investing, it is so hard to be the one sitting with folded arms, not taking the sweet enticement of now, and focusing instead on intermediate means for positional advantage to be exploited later. In weiqi, it takes great discipline to be _shi_, building only potential that may or may not ever really materialize, while one’s _li_ opponent racks up points and appears to be winning by a sizeable margin. Yet it is a choice that we must make, to take on the roundabout burden of the indirect, retreating now and looking foolish (or worse) to the rest of the world. (Klipp used to have a pithy phrase that embodied the difficulty of being _shi_ in a _li_ world, saying to be successful in trading, one had to “look like a jerk feel like a jerk.” Though, what else would we expect from the man who said you had to love to lose money and hate to make it?) Given all the time we’ve spent in the esteemed company of Laozi and Sun Wu, Bastiat and Clausewitz, Menger, Böhm-Bawerk, Mises, and Ford, why would we not want to apply this thinking for ourselves? Not to do so would seem the ultimate foolishness, to turn our back on this archetypal strategic wisdom.

If you are wondering right now, after eight chapters of the roundabout, if the first investment strategy you are receiving basically tells you to **stay out of the market for long periods of time when distortion is running high**, the answer is yes. Although that may seem anticlimactic, it is anything but. To put this in the most straightforward terms, it’s a really big deal—a very different and contrarian (and highly effective) way to approach investing. Just as Klipp’s Paradox of “love to lose money, hate to make money” led to incredible discipline (and some healthy returns) in the trading pit, so, too, does this Misesian approach in anyone’s portfolio.

The objective of roundabout Austrian Investing is not to find a way to make money now, but to position ourselves for better investment opportunities later. Or, as we might state it, we’re being patient now so that we can be strategically impatient later. Whatever you decide to do as an investor, keep in mind the overarching aim of this book; it is about a way of thinking, of understanding the roundabout and the considerable strategic advantages to be gained along the patient, circuitous path. If you take away nothing else from this chapter (or even from this book) know that there is usually imminent danger in the direct approach, in ignoring the means for the ends, particularly in the market when distortion is running high. Thanks to the Misesian Stationarity index, there is a way to gauge that danger so that, no matter what your investment decisions are, you are better informed about those dangers.

Implementing **this cookie-cutter Misesian strategy is extremely ambitious, even audacious (particularly for professionals)**, as Chapter 6 reminds us, because of that humanness about us that gives us a high immediate time preference—further magnified under monetary intervention—and makes it difficult to impossible to forego the immediate marshmallow, even though we may believe there are a great many more marshmallows to come. Think of the Misesian Wall Street investor (an oddity, to be sure) who shows no excess return during the distortion years when he owns low-yielding T-bills (and dramatically underperforms the stock market as it further runs up); he and his ilk would have mostly been weeded out by natural selection over a year or two of underperformance. No über-hyperbolic discounter will ever get to monetize the 2 percent outperformance of the Misesian strategy (though he would be a wealthy star if he could).

There is yet another challenge in executing this Misesian strategy. It requires contrarian thinking, a not-to-be-underestimated psychological feat, to zig when the rest of the world is zagging—to step aside when the rest of the world is scrambling to buy, and to buy when the rest of the world is bailing out of positions. When the MS index goes so low it falls well below 1, then one can act like a corporate raider (particularly common around the last generational low in the MS index in the early 1980s), scooping up good assets that can then be liquidated at a profit—because in the aftermath of a malinvestment purge, title to capital is available for less than the replacement cost. **Think of a low MS index for a cash-rich investor as analogous to the no longer dormant conifer seeds after their serotinous cones have opened, ready to spread throughout the fire-cleared, competitor-free land, enriched by nutrients of their vanquished predecessors.**

### The Eagle and The Swan

The sudden realization of mass correlated entrepreneurial error is Austrian-speak for “stock market crash,” as most if not all companies suddenly are revealed to have been priced wrong, and many are engaged in (and now looking to quickly exit) projects that **one minute were considered profitable, and the next not**. This is of course the retreating rout, to be followed by the counter-rout.

When they occur, stock market crashes seem so irrational to most, so haphazard and unforeseeable, so black swan. But are they irrational? Are they even unforeseeable? Or do they simply stem from the distorting effects of credit expansions as the Austrians suggest? We have already seen (in Figure 9.3) that severe stock market losses (what I’ve called “drawdowns”) follow periods of great distortion. While accumulated losses are likely the only crashes that matter (after all, ==it is the extent to which stock market losses accumulate that they are economically important==), let’s nonetheless take this a step further and look at temporally concentrated stock market losses—those that occur over a month, for instance—selling routs. (I’ll actually use two-month returns in order to best capture noncalendar monthly swings.) **These should be the true mark of a distorted world, since the end to the distortion is a sudden revelation as interest rates rise or credit evaporates, not a slow, orderly correction.** (If it were the latter, it would presumably be correctable through ordinary entrepreneurial adjustments.)

Over the past century-plus, there have been sizeable monthly losses of 20 percent or more in the aggregate U.S. stock market, and they have occurred with exceedingly low frequency. By definition, therefore, it would seem we should be able to call such crashes in the stock market tail events. But on closer inspection, a different story emerges in Figure 9.5.

![S&P 2nd and 5th 1-Month Return, 1901-2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/qp-review/dao-capital-9-5.jpg)

Upon bucketing two-month returns by their starting MS index quartiles (over a 3-year window of overlapping two-month returns following bucketing) and calculating the 2nd and 5th percentiles in each bucket, we see, again, that crashes follow distortion. (This is just as was done in Figure 9.3 with 20th and 50th percentiles of all the cumulative drawdowns, only here I’m looking at 2nd and 5th percentiles of all the two-month returns—meaning, in the case of the 2nd percentile, the realized two-month return at which 2 percent of all the two-month return data in the bucket are lower. Clearly, 20 percent or worse crashes are not the random hundred-year flood as people generally think: **They happen fairly quickly under certain conditions—a very distorted MS index**—while those conditions have happened a handful of times over the past century; moreover, they happen much less quickly (and one would in fact still be waiting) following a low MS index. Once again, with such sound Austrian logic behind these studies, the evidence of distortion and its ramifications to investors is overwhelming: **When the MS index is high ex ante, subsequent large stock market losses and crashes are no longer tail events at all—rather they are perfectly expected events.** To Austrian eyes, these epochal losses were not unforeseeable. (More alarmingly, due to the evidence of monetary credit expansion of late visible in the MS index in Figure 9.1, as of this writing in July 2013, we have no right to be surprised by a severe and imminent stock market crash. In fact, we must absolutely expect it.)

The black swan notion is still paramount, however—I named many of my investment partnerships after it—but only because of the vantage point perception problem: Truly, the real black swan problem of stock market busts is not about a remote event that is considered unforeseeable; rather it is about a foreseeable event that is considered remote. The vast majority of market participants fail to expect what should be, in reality, perfectly expected events. Intertemporally challenged and further blinded by a myopic focus on the now, they price in only Anglo swans, missing the Viennese bird lurking conspicuously in the weeds.

### Prototypical Tail Hedging

When distortions and imbalances in the aggregate capital structure come to an end, by necessity, it happens so ferociously, due to the surprise of entrepreneurs across the economy as they simultaneously discover that they have all committed investment errors. Rather than entrepreneurs serving their homeostatic function of correcting maladjustments, the entire market must adjust itself abruptly through an essentially simultaneous liquidation. What follows in the eyes of those who couldn’t see the distortion is a dreaded tail event.

If the market perceives (or rather prices) a large loss in the stock market as very unlikely, even when such perception and pricing are unwarranted, obviously tremendous opportunity exists—even if only to protect a portfolio against such deleterious losses.

However, while this is something of a glimpse into what I do in my funds, my actual approach is far more nuanced—as it is far beyond the scope and intention of this book. It bears repeating: I am not telling anyone to run out and do this as described; even the very generic version of tail hedging is very hard and involves options that are very illiquid, which makes pricing and taking profits very difficult. Nonetheless, this part of the discussion is meant to serve as a conservative and honest case study, the purpose of which is (beyond further measuring tails) to demonstrate Austrian tools and the application of the roundabout approach through the conditional historical outperformance generated by adding extremely out-of-the-money puts to the S&P Composite Index.

> To begin with a little basic knowledge for readers who are not familiar with options: A put is a derivative instrument that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to take a short position in the underlying security at the strike price—e.g., an equity index such as the S&P Composite. With tail hedging, the puts involved are necessarily, by definition, extremely far out of the money, meaning the strike price at which they become exercisable is very far below the current market price.

The portfolio I am testing in this study purchases 2-month 0.5 delta puts on the S&P Composite Index (approximately 30 percent out of the money, in the case of a 40 percent implied volatility) at the start of each strategy period at an assumed 40 percent starting volatility level (which is a historical median pricing level—and, in fact, within a large range, the return outperformance levels reported are surprisingly robust to this pricing level). After every month, the 2-month put options position is rolled (the existing options are sold and new 2-month puts are purchased, which resets the position every month). A historical, conservative interpolated mapping is utilized, which maps monthly index returns into concurrent monthly changes in pricing (or implied volatility) of the 2-month puts (for monthly vega profit and loss), as well as changes in the pricing spread between 1-month and 2-month puts (for monthly rolling). This mapping allows the test to include time periods before data are even available for options markets, thus providing a much greater range of market environments. **Each month the portfolio spends one half of one percent on puts, and the remaining 99.5 percent stays invested in the S&P index.** No leverage is employed (and, in fact, typically when the market is down by not even 20 percent the entire portfolio is actually net profitable).

Each strategy period encompasses two years of returns, and outperformance measures are annualized and bucketed into quartiles according to the MS index level at the start of each respective period. The periods tested range from 1901 (when the MS index data is first available) to the present. The outperformance mean and 95 percent confidence interval of the mean are calculated for each MS index quartile. All returns include reinvested dividends.

The case study compares the returns when tail hedging is used versus only owning the S&P to determine if and when outperformance occurs and its magnitude. As Figure 9.6 shows, with more than 95 percent statistical confidence, just as we saw in Figure 9.5 (not surprisingly, since both use essentially the same monthly return data), the benefits of tail hedging are highly conditional on levels of distortion as evidenced by the MS index.

![Tail-Hedged S&P 1901-2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/qp-review/dao-capital-9-6.jpg)

When the MS index is in the upper quartile (as it is as I write), there has been an approximate 4 percentage-point outperformance of the Austrian Investing I strategy (or a tail hedged index portfolio) over only owning the index (an outperformance that fades as the starting MS index level falls). Thus, there is a third choice between owning stocks or cash (as in the basic Misesian strategy) in a high distortion environment. (Indeed, when combined with the expected excess returns of equities alone shown in Figure 9.2, it is clear that a tail-hedged equity portfolio is superior to any of the investment industry’s misplaced fine-tuning between equities and cash only.)

This is the roundabout Austrian capitalizing on the fact that investing in far out-of-the-money puts requires intertemporal vision, an indirect route (the likely loss in the immediate, as that one half of one percent spent on puts is lost each month without a crash) to achieving a later potential gain (the eventual profits from the puts, which are then invested in stocks whose subsequent returns will be much higher). (Of course those monthly put costs pale in comparison to the opportunity costs of being uninvested in stocks in the Misesian strategy.) Each option represents a seed in time, a chance for the giant redwood to put down roots into future fire-scorched land. What to most is an immediate sunk cost (a capital investment in what seems unlikely at the peak of the boom to be a potential future crash in the making) is potential to the savvy Austrian investor in the context of his portfolio, both in the profit from his put options and the future compounding returns (new trees) to come from investing in a resulting low MS index environment.

Clearly, expecting a market purge need not be a doom and gloom approach; it is rather a tremendously opportunistic, optimistic approach for one with capital—means—in such an environment, specifically when malinvestment is being liquidated and the MS index becomes exceedingly low. Capital is not destroyed; rather, title just changes hands at more advantageous prices to the buyer. The obvious takeaway is the benefit to investors who have access to effective tail hedging; however, seeing only that conclusion misses the far larger and more important point to understand: the source of this edge. As we know both deductively and now inductively (from Figure 9.6), the edge in the tail-hedging strategy is driven by monetary distortion. I would argue that systemic tail hedging wouldn’t be nearly as important and probably not necessary at all if it weren’t for the distortion.

The fact is, the many people who make predictions about the goodness of tail hedging as an asset class (something inconceivable as recently as when I launched Universa in 2007) without any thought to the environment of monetary distortion or the intertemporal effects on their investment decisions through time are missing most of the story: When the MS index is high, tail hedging further becomes expected-event hedging and provides the investing means for when the MS index is low.

### Central Bank Hedging

It seems that tail hedging, as I have been explicitly practicing for about 15 years now, should be called central bank hedging—or, better yet, as I have coined the term, Austrian Investing I. (This activity over my career likely would have been much less interesting and fruitful without the insights of Mises and the cooperative actions of Federal Reserve Chairmen Greenspan and Bernanke. To which, I note with my hearty thanks, Danke schön, meine Herren. Wir sind jetzt alle Österreicher.)

Austrian Investing I is thus the autocatalytic process of indirect tools begetting greater tools, of profitable positions which then beget even more profitable positions—a roundabout investment process. (**Puts are just as much about reinvesting cash at a market low as they are about making money on the path down to that low.**) Austrian Investing I and II, which are encompassed here and in Chapter 10, respectively, both of which attain the ability to deploy capital where and when it is most productive, and then actually do it, are the destination toward which this book has been aiming all along.

Although the thought process is the important takeaway here, there are demands (and perhaps even a requirement) for investment books to provide action items.  
- In the Misesian strategy discussed earlier, we switched between two choices,profiting from both a full equity position when the MS index was low, and avoiding drawdowns with a full cash position when the MS index was high. This 100 percent treasury bill position provided a roundabout position of advantage in a future period to be deployed as potential investments in titles to capital (i.e., equities) when the price of that capital is much lower (and thus its subsequent productivity and returns are much higher). 
- The use of puts in Austrian Investing I is but a logical (and even more effective) progression from our simple cash position—a somewhat more refined _shi_ strategy. This is the ultimate game of _tuishou_—where yielding to the initial rout is an intermediate step (of zouhua) toward the counter-rout of buying cheap title to productive capital and following (or niansui) the market back again to stationarity; as effective as the option trade is, it is but the prelude, an intermediate waypoint toward an even greater edge, an attack and counterattack. In the option trade is the temporal coordination of capital with its most advantageous and opportune use.

**The put options that comprise our tail hedge serve not only to provide even more liquid capital in a rout for reinvestment, but also allow a large (and even full) investment in stocks during the distortion.** (Think of it as a fast-growing angiosperm with the serotinous cones of a conifer.) It seems the stock versus cash decision of the basic Misesian strategy (and of virtually all asset allocation decisions, and a good bit of academic research) is entirely misplaced with the availability of other such Austrian tools.

### The Roundabout Investor

Although our case study shows the importance of tail hedging, as we look at it on its own merit, we remind ourselves that we cannot confuse it with the Zweck, the end goal in itself. For me, the hedge is a Ziel, an intermediate objective, a waypoint of advantage along a roundabout path known as Austrian Investing. With this perspective, we can also see a link between Austrian Investing I and the basic strategy presented earlier in this chapter of avoiding the market when the MS index is high and exploiting the market when it is low. The commonality of the two strategies—one to pinpoint when to avoid the market and the other to exploit the distortion—is the importance of preserving and generating capital to be deployed opportunistically later, when the moment is right. Thus, tail hedging is, indeed, _shi_, becoming the means and setup for strategic positional advantage—a fully loaded crossbow (with extra arrows in the quiver) to be fired later when the vulnerable target appears. As such, tail hedging is a tool that allows us to actually exploit the distortion and not succumb to it.

## 10. Austrian Investing II
Sieggried {.subtitle}

Recall that this signal tells us that the physical structure of production of the real economy has been, through monetary sleight of hand coerced away from stationarity, and is poised to snap back again as the forces of negative feedback become ever stronger. Once we have identified such a scenario, we can exploit our knowledge (elusive to most, and known only through study of Austrian theory) through two basic responses: We either can keep our capital on the sidelines in reserve (what I have called the basic Misesian strategy), or we can enter positions that opportunistically generate capital when its deployment is most effective (the more sophisticated complement of tail hedging, and what I call Austrian Investing I)—_shi_ strategies all.

Now, in this chapter, we are ready for the second part, where we seek out opportunities that are aligned with the true Böhm-Bawerkian roundabout of the Austrian Unternehmer. Rather than gauging the stationarity (or lack thereof) of the market as a whole, in Austrian Investing II I zoom in on individual firms and their exceedingly heterogeneous capital, moving from the macro to the micro, which is only fitting for an investment philosophy bearing the name Austrian. In so doing, we deploy all the tools we have amassed thus far to scout out and capture those rare roundabout investments that will make us truly Austrian investors.

**Roundabout production, therefore, cannot focus myopically on the immediate profit; rather, it invests teleologically, building the indirect means—the positional advantage—toward the ends of profits that will not materialize in the near term.** In fact, as we will see, it is all the better for us that such evidence is hidden from the rest of the investing public who focus on the seen, and impatiently gobble today’s marshmallows. Their impatience makes them blind to future potential, tomorrow’s profits that are yet unseen but can, if we know where and how to look, be foreseen. Indeed, Austrian Investing II, like Austrian Investing I, is all about the straightforward plan of attack comprised in this book: being patient now in order to be strategically impatient later.

### Siegfried, The Dragon Slayer

In this book, I have developed a code word for highly productive roundabout capital, a name that embodies the best of the Böhm-Bawerkian approach: Siegfried. As we recall from our parable of Nibelungenland in Chapter 7, there is something special about Siegfried, “joyous in victory,” slayer of dragons, entrepreneurial hero, which allows him to provide the best products to consumers with great efficiency (as his trees and pastures and goat herd flourish, thanks to his exquisite Wunderhorn playing). Like Henry Ford, with time Siegfried amasses a roundabout capital structure to make products that people want to buy, when they want to buy them. Therefore, we know that the mark of a true Siegfried is a **high return on invested capital** (ROIC)—best calculated by dividing a company’s EBIT (operating earnings before interest and tax expenses are deducted) by its invested capital (the operating capital required to generate that EBIT). Wisely, Siegfried continually reinvests his profits into his business—becoming increasingly more roundabout—instead of pocketing the profits by paying out high dividends to himself (or just accumulating cash). He is driven to act by what he sees as false prices on his factors of production—his capital and other costs are just too low relative to the prices at which he can subsequently sell his finished products. (To put it simply, **his enterprise can transform dollars spent on inputs into dollars earned from customers at a much higher rate than he could earn by lending the money out**.) A true entrepreneur, Siegfried finds those false prices to be, in Mises’s words, “intolerable”; when he sees them, he has to act, which ineluctably makes him become increasingly roundabout (as he is continually building new roundabout capital from square one) and, therefore, even more efficient in the future. While driven by his ends—profitability—he takes aim on his means—the tools of higher order capital goods.

Most important of all—what truly makes Siegfried a Siegfried—is that he is not all that sensitive to interest rates; his profitability is not terribly contingent upon marginal movements in everyone’s time preferences or the central bank’s imposition of artificial interest rates. Of course, Siegfried is not perfect. When there is a big credit collapse and a liquidation of assets, following a period of monetary distortion, Siegfried will see a decline in his ROIC (even he lost a little in 2008). But his capital likely remains profitable and productive, well above his cost of capital, even if the central bank should suddenly and sharply raise interest rates in the thick of a boom. After such a surprise move by the central bank to “take away the punch bowl,” the Günthers of the world will be crushed, as their bloated enterprises were utterly dependent on the artificially cheap credit of the boom. They will be forced to scale back operations, or fold altogether. In contrast, Siegfried will be okay, as his business model remains fundamentally sound. **In the mass liquidation of the Günthers, the crashing prices of various business inputs may cause Siegfried to regret some of his purchases made at the height of the boom, but that will be a luxurious position compared to many of his peers.**

To move from our fable to an operational strategy for the real (non-Wagnerian) world, note that Siegfried qualifies as our investment ideal because of the first (of two) criterion: high ROIC, which prompts him to keep reinvesting profits into his capital structure to become even more efficient and eventually grow. This pattern explains why we should expect a strong correlation between above-average returns and a roundabout capital structure (even though such a connection is not usually made even among Austrian writers); and this expectation is confirmed by data: High ROIC firms show consistently and significantly greater increases in their invested capital compared to non-high ROIC firms. Academic Austrians tend to view above-average returns—what they would call pure profit as opposed to mere interest earnings—as due to superior entrepreneurial vision, while capital roundaboutness is handled in a separate, equilibrium analysis of interest rates. Yet I claim that in the actual market, we should expect these two Austrian concepts to overlap substantially. Consider: **The entrepreneur who foresees a profit opportunity in the distant future, and who patiently reinvests earnings into his business year after year in anticipation, has a much greater opportunity for (eventually) posting an enormous ROIC than entrepreneurs who are engaged in short-term projects.** (The fewer the rings spanned on Böhm-Bawerk’s Jahresringe, the more commoditized the business.) Thus, while there may be no direct cause-and-effect relationship between capital roundaboutness and above-average returns, once we think through the actual forces governing them, we come to expect an observed, ex post correlation between the two.

Yet as Austrian investors, there is another option open to us: to identify a metaphorical Siegfried and own a piece of him—that is, we can use our funds to buy title to some of his existing operation. We can thus exploit what are false prices only to Siegfried by acquiring and then stepping into his shoes. Yet this route has an additional variable, which makes us take pause: Unfortunately, we should presume that it will cost us dearly to get in. The baseline assumption of efficient capital markets would be that other investors are just as keen as we are, and that the price of stock in a Siegfried would already reflect the tremendous economic advantage indicated by his high ROIC (which is of course public knowledge).

Yet for whatever reasons—and I will give my own thoughts and evidence shortly—this is not always the case. In other words, **in the real financial markets we often encounter high ROIC Siegfried firms where these superior efficiencies at turning invested and reinvested capital into future earnings are apparently not priced in**. Back in Chapter 5, in our discussion of forestry development I explained a concept that we can now fully deploy: In addition to casting our net for firms with a high ROIC, we are also looking for firms with a low Faustmann ratio, meaning a low market capitalization (of common equity) over net worth (or invested capital plus cash minus debt and preferred equity) ratio. In Chapter 5, I explained that this Faustmann ratio is driven by the degree to which the ROIC exceeds the cost of that capital, so clearly one might expect high Faustmann ratios (where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts—or the sum of the factors of production) to accompany high ROICs. (When we make this more realistic and allow for the reinvestment of profits into more land—and thus eventual growth in those profits—this robust relationship remains.) Stating it in Nibelungen terms, we want to acquire ever-more roundabout Siegfrieds while they are priced like breakeven Johanns, or even struggling Günthers.

### Buying the Seigfrieds

Let’s start by looking at the Siegfrieds and confirming that they do, in fact, tend to remain Siegfrieds. (After all, if Siegfrieds were to quickly deteriorate into Johanns, then certainly our presumption of their ever-advantageous roundaboutness would be mistaken.) **On theoretical grounds, we expect a firm with high ROIC to remain in such standing, as its managers will continue to reinvest in the firm (why wouldn’t they?), and this will only further solidify their positions of competitive advantage.**

The data match up with our theoretical deduction. It turns out that high ROICs have been sustainable.2 In Figure 10.1 we see that the Siegfrieds (the top line)—defined here as firms realizing 75 percent or higher ROIC at the start of each 10-year period—have tended to persist as Siegfrieds—or have retained their elevated ROIC by the end of each 10-year period.

![Rolling 10-Year ROIC, 1970-2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/qp-review/dao-capital-10-1.jpg)

To be clear, I acknowledge that there is nothing guaranteeing this result, and no doubt we can find individual firms with high ROICs one year that lapse into low ROICs in the future, or even go bankrupt. This is even assured by the preeminent regression fallacy, whereby an extreme value generated by random noise in a data series is consequently reversed when the noise abates—and assigning meaning to that reversal is a mistake. (Mistaking the deliberately roundabout swerves described in this book for randomness is a similar, though inverse, error.) Yet in the real world the type of farsighted entrepreneurs who continually reinvest earnings are the very people poised to seize profit opportunities that have eluded others, and they are ahead in the capital-configuration race, so that in the aggregate we expect a persistence in high ROIC. The statistical result is even more reasonable once we consider that certain intangible assets (such as the rewards of research and development, or brand-name recognition, or the leadership skills of an owner) will very often show up in the measured return on tangible capital.

Now I will construct portfolios of Siegfrieds, choosing the best handful every month, using a highly robust screen (meaning wild numbers don’t have an undue affect, as I equal weight each purchase): Each month I purchase the lowest Faustmann ratio firms among those with recent ROICs above 100 percent (with further screening for size and liquidity), and I turn them over as they eventually fail to meet our criteria (checking each year). (I ignore fishy financial values as well as sectors like banks.) I start the test in 1978, solely due to requirements for sufficient available data. (I use a spliced combination of Compustat’s Point in Time database, available starting in 1987, and its non-Point in Time database; as is apparent, these results don’t materially change if I restrict myself just to the more timely Point in Time data.)

![Siegfried Cumulative Performance vs S&P](https://s3.amazonaws.com/qp-review/dao-capital-10-2.jpg)

Now, let’s investigate what’s going on under the hood here. Put simply, why are there highly productive firms (ROIC over 100 percent is an outrageously big number) so scorned that they have such low Faustmann ratios to meet our thresholds? It turns out, as Figure 10.3 shows and as we anticipated, among the Siegfrieds (operationally defined in Figure 10.3 as companies with ROICs above 50 percent—in order to provide enough data for comparative significance), those with the lowest (1st quartile) Faustmann ratios (the dark line at the bottom) have seen their subsequent EBITs take a temporary turn for the worse (and the shaded 95 percent confidence region around the mean EBIT changes for the lowest Faustmann ratio bucket indicates the rigor in this statement). In fact, the statistically significant differences between each progressive Faustmann bucket would suggest that the market is actually pricing these differences in. As the EBIT paths diverge at one year, and as guidance and analyst forecasts seem to predict this far out in the future fairly well, this should not be surprising at all; **what should be surprising, at first, is how fooled the market tends to be over the subsequent one-to-two-year bend in the road**. When you consider that these divergences are essentially—even entirely, with high statistical significance—accounted for by spurts of fixed and intangible capital spending, this is all the more surprising. These first-quartile Siegfrieds are merely becoming more roundabout—sacrificing today for growth tomorrow—and paying the price today.

As we know, roundabout production—bearing the costs of capital investment—typically results in an immediate hit on profits (particularly from noncapitalized investment such as research and development). Our constant refrain sounds again: We live in the seen (what is available to us), and we extrapolate the seen such that we are deceived as it curves (minor leaguers hit linearly extrapolated fast balls, major leaguers hit curve balls); the roundabout is hard, and we are not biologically cut out for it. Thus, **the stock market tends to be about immediate bets (or expectations) on distant outcomes**—yet all that matters to the bettors tends to be the immediate outcomes. That is, among high ROIC firms, stock valuations and the resulting Faustmann ratios seem to anticipate future profits in the short run so accurately that they miss the curves and the changeups. It is a doctrine of investing that stocks follow their earnings—that, in the words of Peter Lynch, “It’s the earnings that waggle the wiggles” in the stock market (so “what’s the sense of wasting time on sluggards?”3)—and naturally the near-term earnings are all we see. (As it turns out, stock market investors are less savvy than the hoary forestry investors of ages past, who overcame the dreaded axiom of the axe and saw the faster and more profitable tree growth just around the corner.) The market focuses on immediate profits and growth thereof—immediate progress—all the while treating the productivity of the means of those profits as homogeneous. This is the penalty assessed by the myopic market as the price of Produktionsumweg. The premium goes to the marshmallows produced today, while punishment is meted out on Siegfrieds that devote their profits to becoming more efficient in marshmallow production tomorrow. (No wonder Henry Ford tried to avert equity partners and considered typical Wall Street investment to be a sideshow.) Contrary to my central tenet from Hazlitt’s Economics in One Lesson (from Chapter 1), the markets truly look at just the immediate rather than at the longer effects of capital and production processes; these are the two games always at play, with so little competition in the latter.

The next question to ask is: Just how insulated are our Siegfrieds from the booms and busts of distortion demonstrated in the previous chapter? Since a Siegfried, by definition, is a farsighted visionary—who can better anticipate future market conditions than his peers, and who has spent years building up a roundabout capital structure accordingly—and whose ROIC far exceeds his cost of capital (and his investment plans are thus generally insensitive to movements in rates), we should expect that he is more protected than the Johanns and certainly the Günthers from engaging in malinvestment. Let’s see what actually happened in the data.

Siegfrieds aren’t perfect; they are still exposed to the cluster of errors of distortion—just not as much as everyone else in the market. When the average stock does really well or poorly (as denoted in Figure 10.4 by the S&P Composite gaining or losing more than 20 percent in a year, respectively), so too, relatively—with over 95 percent confidence—does the Siegfried strategy (as seen in the conditional mean annual returns—the light bar—and 20th percentile drawdowns—the lowest dark bar—in Figure 10.4). Thus **the Siegfried strategy benefits from low MS index regimes** (when the S&P Composite has high subsequent returns, as per the previous chapter) and is somewhat hurt by high MS index regimes (when the S&P Composite similarly has low subsequent returns). Overlaying the same intertemporal strategy of the previous chapter—of facilitating opportunistic capital deployment following the routs of distortion—on the present strategy will confer even greater advantages.

### Value Investing
Austrian Investing's Estranged Heir {.subtitle}

Perhaps Graham’s greatest insight was to stay out of the shadows of securities markets, ignore the sideshows, and instead focus entirely on the entrepreneurial action itself—the business, the capital. A diligent researcher of stocks, he had a laser focus on capital as the tangible asset and the thing that is ultimately owned in a stock. We can see this in the MS index and the Faustmann ratio, as well as Graham’s price to book ratio (or P/B, which simply compares a firm’s equity to its total net depreciated book assets); all three ask: What is the whole relative to the sum of its parts? (It is not clear whether Graham ever read Faustmann or the Austrians directly; though he was fluent in German, he admitted to being unschooled in economics.) In his P/B approach, alone, Graham had good results. After adding a litany of quantitative screens—from debt restrictions to long-term earnings and dividend growth and stability to price to earnings (P/E) ratios (spelled out in his book, The Intelligent Investor)—over his long career as an investor he did quite well. (His multi-ingredient, quantitative stock portfolio recipe is the stuff of modern-day financial engineers.)

We might say, however, that traditional value investing has been something of a misnomer: Traditional value stocks (defined by low P/B and P/E ratios) have been shown to have statistically similar revenue growth as traditional growth stocks, and have had lower ROIC than growth stocks.7 This is yet another instance of naïvely treating all capital as the same, as a homogenous blob. Consider that P/B and P/E ratios are utterly incommensurable unless we assume all firms have the same basic capital structure. In reality, firms have different degrees of roundaboutness and hence variability in their ROIC; indeed, investors must always delve deeper into the means of economic profit—certainly a central message of this book.

Between Austrian Investing and value investing is again the difference between depth of field and the telescopic long term. The latter is about waiting patiently over a long interval, as if for a far-off coupon at the very end—the plodding tortoise, or Marco sitting with his rod. The former is about patience now in gathering the factors of greater potential coupons to come—the accelerating tortoise–hare, or Crusoe. Both require discipline and patience, but Austrian Investing is concerned with the intertemporal process at work, rather than just the endpoint.

Over the years, value has sprouted many variations on the Austrian/Grahamian theme. In 1992, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French formalized a value factor, which was basically Graham’s P/B measure.9 Another approach, called “The Magic Formula” by Joel Greenblatt, combines our traditional ROIC screen with a simple EBIT relative to enterprise value screen.10 And there is a similar screen known as “Quality,” whereby high gross profits-to-assets (which avoids penalizing high capital investment) and low P/B ratios are selected.11 These cover the variation gamut (though there are certainly countless subvariations on these, including their intersection, such as perhaps the approach of Buffett), and in fact triangulate or cross-verify the Austrian Investing II approach. All introduce noise by assuming additional degrees of freedom: too many to name (in the case of Graham’s intricate screens), heterogeneous capital productivity (in the case of Fama-French’s sole P/B parameter), heterogeneous EBIT growth rates (in the case of Greenblatt’s growth-sensitive P/E parameters), and heterogeneous capital depreciation and thus productivity (in the case of Quality’s depreciation-free gross profit parameter). But as much as they might approximate this approach, they fail to necessarily isolate what matters: roundabout capital and its price. So we should expect these variations to capture some of the Siegfried portfolios, some of their edge, but with some added noise, evident in lower returns resulting from lower information content in the screening methods used, as well as inconsistencies across a range of portfolio construction methods employed.

To see if this expectation holds, I tested the performance of these portfolios: In my experiment, I own 40 stock positions for one year, and I stagger how many I buy in each monthly mini-portfolio in different ways, as well as limit how large each mini-portfolio as well as each position may swell before constraining it. Such variation and somewhat arbitrary portfolio construction techniques result in essentially different portfolio constituents, and thus nicely reveal a degree of luck and inconsistency in some of these results—as well as remove much of any ability to optimize (thus keeping the author honest). All portfolios share the same screens, ranging from tradability (size) constraints and general noise constraints. I start the tests in 1978, as before (which, once again, doesn’t impact the relative results). Figure 10.5 shows the range of performances found, as well as the mean performance across this range.
