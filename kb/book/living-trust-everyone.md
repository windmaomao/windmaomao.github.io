#Living Trust For Everyone

## Preface

There are four fundamental purposes and advantages of a trust.

- The first is **asset management**. It could be a mistake to give certain beneficiaries a lump sum inheritance. They may be too young to properly manage money on their own, may be mentally incapable of managing it, or may not have enough maturity or good sense to be good money managers. Using a will to leave your assets to your young children may result in money going to someone too young to properly manage it.

- The second benefit this **tax reduction**. While the estate tax now hits fewer people than before due to the high threshold, a trust of one kind or another can either eliminate or greatly reduce estate and inheritance taxes. This purpose is considered by many nonexpert attorneys to be the only reason to have a trust––thus their oft-given yet erroneous advice: You don’t have enough money to need a trust.

- The third advantage is **probate avoidance**, which is a valuable benefit. The big lie put forth by some attorneys and bar associations is that probate is not that expensive and there is no good reason to try to avoid it. The truth is that probate is usually very expensive (because of attorney fees) and is in nearly all cases totally unnecessary if a properly prepared and funded living trust had been prepared. Attorneys who say a trust is not needed are either ignorant of the value of trusts or have a vested interest in seeing probate continue.

- The fourth benefit this for those who wish to **avoid a court-ordered conservatorship** should they become so disabled as to be unable to manage their own affairs. If, for example, a person has dementia, the trust can have provisions that allow a successor trustee (the one who would take control at death) to take over financial management of the trust assets. This helps the person avoid the expense and embarrassment of court supervision.

There is also a grab bag of additional benefits, including 

- privacy (probate is public record; trusts are most often not), 
- low cost (there are no court costs, filing fees, or estate inventory fees on a trust at death), 
- ease of administration, 
- lower likelihood of someone contesting the estate, and 
- elimination of the time delay caused by probate of a will.

## Trusts and Wills Defined

Wills have to be probated.

Trusts don’t. Avoiding probate is a big deal, no matter what your lawyer tells you. And the living trust is the best way to do it.

### What is a Will?

A will is really just a written document telling who gets what part of your stuff at your death, when they get it, and who is in charge of getting the assets to the people who are supposed to get them. You can write your own will in your own handwriting (what lawyers call a holographic will) or it can be typed up, usually by a lawyer, and ceremonially witnessed and/or notarized. You can buy a will online or even get a fill-in-the-blank one at the office supply store. Some states even have a state-promulgated “statutory will,” which is another fill-in-the-blank form. Wills are pretty easy to make and are usually less expensive to create than a trust. The big cost of a will comes later, when the probate fees are counted in.

### What is a Trust?

A trust is also just a written document. It also says who gets what, when they get it, and who is in charge of seeing that that happens. The person in charge is the trustee. The difference is that a trust does not have to go through the probate court.

The reason a trust is not probated is that when a trust is signed, it becomes a legal entity that has the ability to own things. I often analogize it to the hardware store down the street. Smith’s Hardware is a corporation. The corporation owns the building, the inventory, the delivery truck, the hardware bank account, the money in the cash register—all the hardware store assets. The Smiths own the corporation. If they die, the corporation is, in a sense, still alive and will keep selling hardware. New owners come in and take over the business operation.

A trust is similar. In a trust, the trust owners (the “grantors,” “trustors,” or “settlors”) transfer their assets into the name of the trust. Let’s call it “The Smith Trust.” After they sign the trust document, The Smiths then “fund” the trust. In other words they transfer their assets into the trust name. This is done in a few ways, but typically real estate is deeded into the name of the trust by using a quit claim deed. Bank accounts may either be put into the name of The Smith Trust or may pay on death (POD) to the trust (kind of like a beneficiary designation). Life insurance is transferred by naming the trust as the beneficiary. Tax deferred accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s may have the trust as the primary or contingent beneficiary.

The idea is to have The Smith Trust own all the Smiths’ assets. That way, at the death of the Smiths, there is nothing left in their individual names for the probate court to administer. The trust owns their stuff , but they own the trust. They die and the trust still owns their stuff , but the trust document then kicks in. The trust says who takes over at their death to carry out their instructions on who gets what and when.

The great thing is that there is no court order needed for the trustee to take over after the Smiths die. The trustee merely has to show proof that they are dead and show the trust to prove who is the trustee. Then, literally the day after they die, the trustee can begin carrying out their instructions on distributing the trust assets. How the trustee does all this is explained in simple language in the last chapter.

## You Must Have a Trust If

### Minors

If you do not have a trust and die while your children are still young, the inheritance will be given to them in a lump sum when they reach the “age of majority”—age eighteen in most states. In the meantime, the money is held in a court-supervised conservatorship account under the control of the minor’s guardian or conservator. There are three things wrong with this.

### Disabled Beneficiaries

There are millions of disabled people. Disabilities may exist from birth or may be inflicted later on as a result of accident or illness. Mental and physical problems of an heir require that someone else take care of the special needs of the person so that assets are used in the heir’s best interests. The disabled person may be perfectly capable of making financial decisions, but leaving that right to them may mean they are disqualified from certain benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled.


### Spendthrifts

We all know people who just cannot hold onto money. If they have it, they spend it. If they can borrow it, they will spend it. Their credit cards are maxed out. They may have declared bankruptcy, had repossessions, or even been sued for non-payment of bills. These people are spendthrifts and will spend their inheritance very quickly if it is not protected for them. 

### Gay Couples/Unmarried

An unmarried couple, whether gay or not, needs the protection only a trust can offer. Unmarried couples do not have the legal rights afforded to those who are married.

### Blended Families

In the typical family unit today, one or both partners may have been previously married and they may both have had children from those prior marriages. Estate planning is an absolute must in these situations. Otherwise, everything may end up in the hands of the children of the spouse who lives the longest.

- The first consideration is to be sure your current spouse is protected by the trust provisions. 
- The second factor is survival. Without a trust or will, the assets will, in most cases, belong to the surviving spouse. At her death, those assets would by law go to her children.

A trust can contain very flexible provisions to meet your intentions. For example:

1. At the death of one spouse an immediate distribution of certain assets or money is made to that person’s children, with the rest staying in trust for the benefit of the survivor.
2. At the death of one spouse the income from the marital trust assets could be paid out to the survivor as earned, with the remainder at death paid out to all the children of both spouses.
3. The trust could become unchangeable at the death of one spouse to insure that the children of the first spouse to die are not disinherited by the survivor. This means, in effect, that the trust becomes irrevocable at the first death.
4. Most commonly the surviving spouse gets the use and ownership of all the trust assets but cannot change the trust to effectively disinherit the children of the first spouse to die.

Any rules that you think are fair and both agree on can be put into the trust rules and regulations. The above are just a few examples. The point is that if you do not decide now, then state law will decide for you—and you may not like what the law would do.

### Separated Couples or Trusts

Sometimes both spouses don’t agree on what would go into a joint trust and want separate plans funded with their own separate assets. Especially if a couple is separated, each wants to be certain that the trust is not going to be invaded after the death of the first by the survivor. In most states, if both parties agree, the trust assets in separate trusts are not reachable by the survivor except as specifically spelled out in the trust documents. The trust becomes in effect a postnuptial agreement.

### Large Estates

Trusts can eliminate or dramatically reduce estate and inheritance taxes. You might think you do not need to worry about estate tax since the threshold right now is $3.5 million, but keep in mind that the IRS considers all assets taxable. So life insurance, retirement plans, and real estate, as well as traditional investments, are considered taxable. I have seen young parents with very little in the way of liquid assets who have multi-million dollar life insurance policies (which are taxable for estate tax purposes at their deaths) and who ended up paying a huge estate tax bill that could have been avoided with a trust.

This is important because it is a big tax. The tax rate is 37 to 45 percent of everything over the threshold (though the rate is also subject to legislative change). So a $4 million estate could have a tax bill of $200,000.

Large estates can also achieve significant estate and income tax savings using the more sophisticated types of trusts, such as charitable remainder trusts, as well as family limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and other complex estate planning techniques. Consult an estate planning expert to develop a plan for you.

### Small Estates

Even some very small estates benefit from having a trust. You should refer to chapter 9, where I discuss small estates in detail, but in some cases a trust is called for even if non-trust alternatives are available. For example, you may have only your house, a small savings account, and a life insurance policy to leave your children at your death. These could be handled without a trust and without probate by devices such as joint ownership and beneficiary designations.

### Disability

All this is avoided with a trust. The trust has language that defines when a person is to be considered incapacitated, and when that occurs, the alternate or successor trustee immediately steps in and begins managing the assets of the trust owner. When combined with the medical directives and power of attorney that are part of the trust-based estate plan (see chapter 12), there is no need for a court-supervised guardianship and conservatorship. In fact, I have defeated petitions for guardianship in court merely by showing the judge that the proposed ward already had a durable power of attorney as well as a revocable trust with a trustee in place managing the assets.


## A Comparison: Trusts and Wills

### Real Estate in More Than One State

With a trust, all the real estate from every state can be put into one trust ownership using a quit-claim deed and there is no probate in any state. The trustee merely hires an attorney in the companion state to do a deed from the trust to the beneficiaries, or the trustee sells the property in the other state through the trust. No probate and no expenses other than realtor and closing fees.

Huge savings in time, trouble, and money.

### Family Harmony

Trust settlement without an attorney can be done quickly and with no legal costs. Because everything is wrapped up so fast, there is not much time for heirs to worry about the process. You basically gather together the assets, pay the bills, file the last year’s income tax return, and distribute the assets to the heirs—that’s it. No papers to file with a court or the state, no fees to pay.

No-contest clauses and arbitration clauses also limit challenges to trusts. A no-contest clause is a paragraph or two that says that anyone who challenges the trust, even if they are successful, would get **only one dollar as their inheritance**. While this clause is not a bar to challenging a trust on the basis that the maker of the trust was senile or otherwise incompetent when they made the trust, the fact that the provision is there stops a lot of trust contests. It’s kind of like the sign in the parking garage that says they are not responsible for loss or damage to your car. The sign itself discourages people from suing even if the garage might have been legally responsible.

To contest a trust, the one contesting must hire and pay for a lawyer out of his own pocket. There is no probate court priority for attorney fees and it can be difficult to find a lawyer willing to take on a trust contest on a contingency fee basis (getting their attorney fees out of the winnings). Trusts are a more certain way of seeing that your intentions and instructions are carried out at death and are not thwarted by litigation.

### Privacy

Probate files are public record. Many people are not aware of this, but anyone can go to courthouse, look at any court file, and find out who inherited what and how much they got. 

A trust is private. No one other than the heirs know what anyone inherited, what restrictions there might be, or even the size of the estate. Most of us want this information private, and a trust keeps it that way.

The privacy aspect also makes it harder to contest since only the heirs involvded can get a look at the paperwork. 

## Trust Seminars
A Free Dinner, But at What Cost? {.subtitle}

Mom was never going to buy a Buick and I think the dealer knew that, but **sales is a numbers game**—get in front of enough people and some will buy. It’s the same thing with these seminars. Some people go to all the ones they are invited to just to get the free meal. But some of the guests are new and some of them eventually get convinced.

I have been approached by a number of companies over the years who put on these seminars. They ask me if they can refer their customers to me to prepare a trust-based estate plan for them. I have to very carefully investigate companies making such requests. Some are good, and some are downright crooked. As a consumer **you have to be cautious with whom you deal in financial and legal matters**, particularly when you are revealing your personal financial and family information to them.

## Watch Out for Attorneys

## Trustees

A trustee is someone you can trust—someone who will take charge of your trust documents after your death and carry out your wishes. What does a trustee typically do? Not only the financial things such as gathering together investments, insurance death benefits, and selling real estate, but the more mundane things like cleaning out the garage and basement, making funeral arrangements, doing your final income tax returns, and paying any leftover bills. So while it does take some time, most of these duties do not require the services of a lawyer.

How can you be sure your trustee can be trusted? There are ways to be more certain your trustee does the job faithfully and honestly. One good way is to name two trustees as co-trustees to act together, especially if it is a blended family in which each parent has a separate set of children. Taking one child from each side of the family creates a situation where they watch each other and are more likely to do things properly.

For example, there is in most states a set of laws commonly known as the “Prudent Investor Rules.” These basically say that a trustee must be conservative and careful in managing the assets of the trust. The trustee must not put the trust assets in jeopardy by making risky investments. The trustee has statutory obligations to keep good accounting records and keep the trust beneficiaries informed as to what is happening with the trust. You need an organized trustee who keeps good records, so it is very important to choose the correct trustee.

Years ago, it was common to choose professional trustees— usually the trust department of a local bank. That still happens, but typically for larger trusts. The problem with professional trustees, in my experience, is that they are not too willing to exercise their discretionary power to make distributions to beneficiaries.

Most people choose family members as trustees to simplify things and keep the costs down.

### You As Trustee

The trustee is the one who is in charge of the trust. In most cases, the grantor (the maker and owner of the trust) is his own trustee during his lifetime. Couples usually have joint trusts or are co-trustees. If one of the couple dies, the survivor usually remains the sole trustee until death or disability.

The trust becomes irrevocable (unchangeable) after the death or disability of the grantors but is revocable (changeable) during their lifetimes so long as they are capable and competent. These are the general rules. However, people often have reasons to do things differently.

Bank trustees typically charge 1 to 1.5 percent of the trust assets annually as a fee for serving as trustee. Family members who are also beneficiaries usually do it for free however, it is not uncommon to specify a payment to a trustee for carrying out your trust instructions. Trustees are, of course, entitled to any actual expenses they incur, but also may have to take time off work to meet with accountants or real estate agents or to do other trust-related business. **Allotting a set amount of money as a trustee fee on top of whatever the trustee may inherit is not at all unusual and is, I think, appropriate.** The amount will depend, of course, on the level of work involved. If the trustee is merely going to wrap up your estate, pay the bills, and hand out the money, a lump sum trustee fee appropriate to the size of the estate would be determined.

However, if the trustee is to continue to act as trustee in years to come to care for the trust fund of a minor or disabled person, an annual fee should be allocated. **Keep in mind that a trustee fee is taxable income to the trustee, whereas if you left the trustee a share of the trust as an heir, it would not be considered income**, so a share of the estate is more valuable than an equivalent amount of money as a fee.

### Back-up Trustees

What if your selected trustee cannot or will not act as trustee when the time comes? It is always a good idea to have a second and even a third alternate trustee named in your documents.

In your trust, there should be language that provides a mechanism for choosing an alternative trustee if there is none named who is able to do the job. I suggest allowing the beneficiaries to elect a trustee if you can’t come up with one, with the guardians of child beneficiaries voting for them. There may be other requirements if the trustee will be enforcing restrictions on when and how a beneficiary receives his share of the trust. You cannot have a trustee in charge of his own restrictions especially in a special-needs trust situation.

### Who Cannot Be a Trustee

A beneficiary of a special-needs trust cannot be the sole trustee of that trust. The reason is that in a special-needs trust the trustee has the discretionary authority to make whatever distributions the trustee deems appropriate for the beneficiary, provided that benefit programs are not reduced by the distribution. A special-needs beneficiary may end up being disqualified because of the assumed ability to exercise trustee discretion in favor of the beneficiary.

A trustee must be of legal age, mentally competent, should be a resident of the United States, and not a ward of the state under a guardianship order. It helps if the chosen trustee hasa good business head and is well organized. Check with your attorney to see if there are special restrictions in your state. A bond is not normally necessary, but if it is the trustee has to qualify for the bond.

A bond is a type of insurance policy that covers any losses to the estate due to the misfeasance or malfeasance of the person bonded. Bonds are only given to bondable people—that is, those who have no criminal history or past conduct that would make them a possible risk to the insurance company. So if the conservator of a person’s money runs off with it, the bonding company makes good the loss, then goes after the conservator.

## Making Your Trust Work: Funding

In my law practice it is not unusual to see clients die who had a trust that was not fully “funded” at the time of their death. Funding is just a word to describe the process of transferring assets to the trust. Any assets left out of the trust will have to go through probate to get into the trust.

In some cases there is a trust but no assets at all in the name of the trust—a trust may be fully funded, partially funded, or unfunded. We strive for a fully funded trust to get the probate avoidance advantage.

Everything does not have to go to the trust. As stated earlier, the trust only controls the assets it owns or that pass to it at the death of the grantor. Sometimes a grantor will **leave a particular asset such as a bank account or insurance policy to a person outside of the trust by way of beneficiary designation or joint ownership**. This is often the case in a blended family where one spouse will leave an asset to his separate children, with the balance of all the trust assets going to all of the children of both spouses. The general rule, though, is that all assets should either be in the name of the trust, pass to the trust at death, or pass to someone else at death. Nothing should have to be probated.

### Funding Methods

#### Real Estate

Real estate is transferred to a trust by way of a deed in most cases. The deed is made from the owner of the real estate to the trustee as trustee of the trust. The deed may be deeded from the grantor to the trust as follows:

“John Smith as trustee of the John Smith Revocable Trust dated January 2, 2010.”

In either case the grantor can either record the deed immediately or deliver it to the trustee to be recorded after the death of the grantor. Attorneys are not in agreement as to whether the deed to the trust should be recorded immediately or later, upon the death of the grantor. The advantage of recording is that the deed cannot be lost and you will know it is in proper recordable form. There are states that say that an unrecorded deed is not valid, cannot be recorded after the death of the grantor, and has not effectively been completed until recording. This is another thing to ask your lawyer.

Recording a deed makes it public record, which means that anyone who looks can find out that you have a trust. Recording a deed may also affect certain property tax issues such as homestead rights and may result in removing caps on property assessments. Recording fees may also be high in some states. There are often exemptions available for transfers into a person’s revocable trust, so be sure to ask the local tax assessor or your attorney.

Also ask your attorney about potential problems with real estate insurance and title insurance if real estate is in the name of the trust.

#### Bank and Credithunion Accounts

Bank accounts can either be put into the name of the trust directly or, in most institutions, have the trust named as either a co-owner of an existing account or a beneficiary of the account. The bank may not use the word beneficiary, may call it a “pay on death” (POD) or “transfer on death” (TOD) designation, but it amounts to the same thing. As trust owners, we do not care how the bank or institution does it, so long as at our deaths the money ends up in the trust without probate.

To accomplish the transfer, you need only take your trust certificate (sometimes called the trust abstract) to the bank, where they will copy it and have you sign the appropriate paperwork to make the transfer. You will find that they have had experience with trusts and will guide you on how they handle these accounts at their bank. They may even use a shortened version of the trust name to fit their system. This is okay.

#### Stocks, Brokerage Accounts

These can also be put directly in the name of the trust, though the transfer process for stocks not being handled by a broker can be trickier. For broker accounts, we send them your trust certificate and they provide the necessary paperwork to either change the account name or put into effect a TOD or POD. This should not be a transaction for which you are charged a fee since it is not a sale or purchase of securities. It is also not a taxable event for capital gains tax purposes.

Stock in a “closely held” corporation may only be transferred to your trust if the corporation’s by laws allow it. A closely held corporation is one in which the stock is not publicly traded.

Stock in “sub-chapter S” corporations may be held in trust but only while the grantor (maker) of the trust is alive. At his death, the trust must distribute the stock to qualified beneficiaries or divest itself of it within a certain period of time or the corporation risks losing its special tax status.
Online brokerage accounts, such as E-Trade, AmeriTrade, ScottTrade, and others can also be in the name of your trust. In most cases you can download the forms and instructions from their Web sites. They will ask that a copy of the trust certificate be sent to them along with the forms, which may have to be notarized.

As for retirement accounts, Keoghs, IRAs, and 401(k)s, be aware that a transfer of such accounts to a living trust may be considered a taxable distribution of deferred income; therefore, these should not be put in the name of the trust but should have the trust named as the contingent beneficiary of these accounts with the spouse being the primary beneficiary. This is so that upon the death of one spouse the other retains easier rollover elections. A beneficiary change form and instructions are usually available from the plan administrator.

Titled assets such as vehicles, trailers, boats, and motor-homes can be put into trust ownership by having the title changed at the local Secretary of State or state tax office (or whatever the name is for the state agency issuing titles).


#### Other Assets and Unusual Situations

Royalties are rights to percentages of profits and can be available for a variety of things. Book royalties will be paid to an author for as long as a book is in publication. Assigning these to a trust will require the permission of the publisher, and I have seen publishers refuse to agree to the assignment. This creates a situation where the estate of the author must deal with royalty checks for years after the rest of the estate has been settled and closed.

Royalties on oil or gas leases are paid for a fixed period of time according to the terms of the original written lease sand are typically assignable to a trust. Other royalties on things such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, profit percentages on films, songs, software programs, and business contractual arrangements may or may not be assignable, depending upon the contract that was signed. In my office we assign these to the trust even if we are not sure, because it costs nothing if we are wrong but is a great advantage if we are right.

#### Celebrity Images

We have all heard that Elvis makes more money now than he did when he was alive. The royalties received by his estate were not assigned to a trust so far as I know, but could have been. Celebrity images and the use of a name are intangibles that can be assigned to a trust.

### Instructions to You
As The Grantor and Trustee {.subtitle}

Taxes

: There are no separate tax numbers necessary. You file your taxes just as you always have in the past without reference to the trust. There is no trust tax return required unless, at the death of a brantor, the trustee is to take over and continue for the benefit of a trust beneficiary.

Banking

: Once your bank and credit union accounts are either in the name of the trust or have a pay-on-death designation filed for them, you do nothing different from what you did before. You checks do not have to have the name of the trust imprinted upon them, even though the account is in the name of the trust. You do not have to write the word "trustee" after your signature. 

Real Estate

: The sale or mortgage of real estate operates in exactly the same fashion as before, except if the deed to the trust has been recorded, the name of the seller is the trust and you sign as trustee. The buyer or his title company may require an affidavit from you stating that the trust is still in operation and that you have the authority to sell the property. Upon your death, the successor trustee can immediately assign the property of the trust to the heirs as you have instructed (after paying all your debts, taxes, and other expenses, of course). No probate court directives are necessary. The death certificate is normally recorded with the county deeds records.

Newly Acquired Assets

: Don’t forget as time goes by that you have a trust. If you buy new real estate, get a deed made to the trust for the new property. Do the same when opening new accounts or acquiring any new titled assets. These must be funded to the trust in order to keep them out of probate.

Changing Your Mind

: Trusts are easily changed. Much more easily, in fact, than wills. To change a will, you need to sign a codicil. This is a written amendment to the will that must be signed with the same statutory formality of the will itself, which may mean having two disinterested witnesses and in some cases a notary. Changing a trust in most states can be done merely by signing a dated, written statement explaining what you are changing. In some states the trust amendment does not even have to be witnessed or notarized, though as a way of avoiding a fight over whether you actually signed the document or whether you were competent when you did it, I recommend having witnesses and notarizing. The point is that the trust is revocable, which means it is changeable so long as you are mentally competent.

Revoking the Trust

: Defunding just means taking the assets out of the trust name. While you can sign a document that says the old trust is officially revoked, that is not necessary unless the trust is registered with a court. The trust ceases to exist for all intents and purposes when it has nothing left in its name and nothing is to pass to it on anyone’s death.

## You Do Not Need a Trust If...

I know I stated earlier that nearly everyone needs a trust for one reason or another, but in certain very limited situations a trust may not be needed for some people. Sometimes cost is a concern since having an attorney prepare a trust can cost much more than will preparation and you may just not be able to afford the trust.

### Alternatives to Wills and Trusts

No Assets

: A person who owns no real estate or investments often will not go through probate, so probate avoidance would not be a reason to have a trust. Bank accounts can have co-owners on them or in some cases, beneficiaries (sometimes called pay-on-death designees).

Beneficiary Designations

: Beneficiary designations can be a way of avoiding probate if there are no other probatable assets. Probatable assets are those that must go through the probate process in order to transfer title to them to the heirs who are supposed to receive them. Some assets, though, are not subject to probate, because there is another way of transferring them.
: - Life Insurance. Everyone knows that life insurance is left to the policy owner’s survivors by way of a written beneficiary designation. The beneficiary then is the person who receives the life insurance payoff at the insured’s death.
  - Retirement Accounts. Tax deferred accounts come in many flavors, such as IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, SEP accounts, tax deferred annuities, and many more. All of these can be left to an heir by naming that person as the beneficiary of the account.
  - Joint Ownership. One of the traditional ways of avoiding probate, often recommended by lawyers, was to add someone’s name on an account or a parcel of real estate. At the death of the original owner, all that had to be shown was the death certificate, and the property belonged to the survivor. It does work to avoid probate.
  - Gifts. Putting someone else’s name on your account or property with the intention that they receive it at your death is a gift to them. The gift is subject to federal gift tax laws, and if the value of the gift exceeds the annual exclusion amount ($13,000 at the time of this writing, and which increases annually based on an inflation adjustment), a gift tax return is supposed to be filed to give that information to the IRS.

Tax Basis

: The whole area of tax basis, carryover tax basis, and stepped-up tax basis (covered in appendix C) is in flux right now. Under current law, making a gift of property to a person by putting his name on it as a way of avoiding probate may result in a much lower tax basis for that person (meaning higher capital gains taxes) than would putting it into a trust where he could elect to get a stepped-up tax basis (meaning lower capital gains taxes).

## The Many Types of Trusts

“Trust” is only five letters long, but it is a big word. There are dozens of kinds of trusts, complex and simple, for all sorts of purposes. In this book, we are talking about fairly simple trusts, which the IRS refers to as “revocable grantor trusts” (what we normally call revocable living trusts). Revocable just means changeable. The grantor is the person who owns the trust itself. During the grantor’s lifetime he may change or revoke the trust. At his death or disability the trust is unchangeable or irrevocable.

Attaining a certain age. All the money is held in trust until the beneficiary reaches age twenty-five, for example. Up until then the trustee may be given the authority to use the money for the beneficiary’s health, education, welfare, and general living expenses. I have even seen people set up requirements that a portion of the money is to be held as a retirement account for the beneficiary to be turned over to him at age sixty-two and invested until then, essentially creating a retirement account for someone who might otherwise not have one. There may even be provisions allowing money to be paid out in certain limited instances such as medical emergencies. There also must be a provision saying where the money goes if the beneficiary dies before age sixty-two.

## Problems with Trusts

Trusts are not a panacea. That is, there can be problems associated with using trust as an estate settlement method. Trust is the primary problem. Your trustee has to be trustworthy. Since there is no oversight by a court or anyone else, the trustee is the one responsible for making good decisions—investment decisions, financial management decisions, and so forth.

For example, in a down stock market it may be wise to hold stocks for a period of time rather than selling to protect the value of the trust principal. Timing of the sale of assets is a financial management decision. Selecting which assets in which to invest trust funds is a critical decision. Trustees are supposed to be conservative and, absent instructions to the contrary, are supposed to diversify the trust investments. Certainly we would not want to choose a trustee who might invest all the funds in Enron stock.

But because there is no oversight, the only ones the trustee has to report to are the trust beneficiaries, and then only after the fact. The trustee is required to keep good records and keep the trust beneficiaries informed as to trust income and expenses. Unfortunately, by the time the beneficiaries find out about a mistake, the money may already be gone with no way to recover it.

How do we remedy this potential problem? There are four ways:

-  Find a very reliable trustee who will not make these mistakes and who will act honestly. This is a judgment call at best.

-  Use co-trustees. When more than one trustee is responsible for trust management, there is less likelihood of sloppy bookkeeping, poor asset management, or a trustee embezzling the trust funds.

- Use an institutional trustee. Banks and trust companies are in the business of acting as trustees and managing trust funds. Their fees typically are about 1 percent of the trust assets per year, but they often can make that up in higher earnings than an individual trustee investor can achieve.

- Register the trust with the court. Most courts have procedures that allow a trust to be supervised by the local probate court. While this may be more trouble for the trustee and may incur annual attorney fees, it is a way of insuring as best we can that the trust instructions will be carried out and that the trust assets will be preserved. Generally, we do not want court oversight because of the additional paperwork and bureaucracy attendant, but if you are unsure of your trustee’s likelihood of acting in the best interests of your estate, you may want to go for it.

### The Trust Protector

The Uniform Trust Act, which is currently in force or pending in a couple dozen states, provides potential protection for trust beneficiaries from a wayward trustee or from changes in circumstance. The act allows the grantors of the trust to appoint a third party or a committee of outside people to supervise the trustee.

The protector’s role is set out in the language of the trust document. The protector may be given limited rights to be sure that the intent of the grantors is carried out. These powers may include the right to change the trustee, to change the terms of the trust, or even to add beneficiaries under certain conditions. The rights of the protector are limited to what is given to him in the trust. The purpose is first to be sure the trustee is doing what is supposed to be done. The second purpose is to be sure that if unexpected changes occur the trust is still going to do what was intended.

Family members and beneficiaries should not be the protector, though they may be considered as a committee the protector consults before making a change in the trust. Typically, the protector would be the family accountant, a trusted financial advisor, or other disinterested non-beneficiary third party.

Actually, it is not necessary for the Uniform Trust Act to be enacted in your state for you to have a protector. Trusts are so flexible that you can add the specific language to create this position even without the act. Just be careful putting it in if it is not needed since this means there is someone looking over the shoulder of the trustee at all times and may add significant cost and delay to the trust settlement process.

### Trusts and Creditors

A revocable trust does not provide asset protection. There are seminars and courses offered that promote the use of trusts as a way of protecting your assets from your creditors. Most of these involve the use of either irrevocable trusts or off shore trusts with foreign trustees and are sold for big prices by those running the seminars. In some cases these techniques work, but sometimes they can be disastrous, and the trust owner finds himself prosecuted for fraudulent transfers or income tax evasion. Be very careful and get independent legal advice before using any of these types of trusts. Similarly, having your assets in a revocable trust does not guarantee that you will qualify for Medicaid benefits for nursing home care. The asset and income limitations still apply, and trust assets are considered as your assets for qualification purposes.

**The purpose of the revocable living trust is not creditor protection. The trust described in this book has as its purposes: probate avoidance, asset management, and estate tax minimization, but not protection from creditors or lawsuits.**

### Gauardian and Trustee Are Two Different Roles

One problem we occasionally see is when the guardian of minor children is also named as the trustee of their trust fund money. This is an inherent conflict of interest since the guardian would be the one asking the trustee for funds for the care of the children. It sounds okay but can lead to abuses.

Had the trustee and guardian roles been separated, it is unlikely the trustee would have agreed to the building of the playroom.

### Why You May Not Want a Joint Trust

A joint trust between two or more people normally will have their joint and individual assets funded into it. Then there is one set of instructions that tell the trustee what to do with those assets at one or both deaths. The first thing that is done after identifying the assets is paying the debts. That can be a problem.

If one partner has a lot of debt that is not jointly owed by the other partner, the amount of the individual debt will have to be paid from the joint trust assets at the death of the debtor. This can be disastrous to the surviving grantor.
