## Exclusions — Tax Free Money
Tax-Free Money

The most important thing that you as a taxpayer can do to reduce your taxes to zero is to convert fully taxable income into excludable income. An exclusion is something that is not included in gross income. It is the best kind of revenue to receive. If you are in the 25 percent tax bracket (single, taxable income over $37,950), each dollar you convert to excludable income is the equivalent of getting a raise of 25 percent! Therefore, in negotiating compensation, you as an employee-taxpayer should ==examine the following forms of nontaxable remuneration for services rendered as **alternatives to fully taxable cash income**==.

### 7 "Expenses of Your Employer"

The law does not tax reimbursement expenses that are true reimbursements for expenses of your employer rather than income amounts truly compensatory in nature.

Under this category are such items as reimbursements for cab fares and the payment of supper money. Rather than being excludable on the basis of statutory or constitutional language, these items are truly nontaxable as the result of Internal Revenue Service recognition of the impossible administrative verification problems in auditing such expenses. For whatever reasons, therefore, they are nontaxable.



### 13 Employer Educational Assistance

This provision excludes from an employee’s gross income employer-provided educational assistance, regardless of whether or not the education is job-related. The provision did not apply to any payment for graduate-level courses (except for those taken in 1995 and those beginning prior to July 1, 1996) taken by an individual pursuing a program leading to an advanced academic or professional degree and is generally not available for any education involving sports, games, or hobbies. Employers are not required to withhold on educational assistance payments, but the exclusion is limited to $5,250 per individual per calendar year. Educational expenses that would be deductible by an employee as trade or business expenses if they had been paid by the employee are not subject to this $5,250 cap.

The 2001 Tax Relief Act made this exclusion permanent and it was extended to cover graduate education as of January 1, 2002. Every employer who maintains an educational assistance program must file a return showing the number of employees eligible to participate in the program; the number participating; the total cost of the program; the employer’s name, address, and taxpayer identification number; and the type of business in which the employer is engaged.

### 14 Employee Awards

*The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed these rules.* That law states specifically that employee awards will *not* be excludable from the employee’s income as gifts. Since such awards will no longer be treated as gifts (and are therefore fully includable as income to the employee), the limitations described on employer deductions for business gifts will no longer apply. The entire amount of the award (assuming ordinary, necessary, and reasonable tests are met) will be deductible.

*Under current law* if the cost to the employer of the qualified plan award exceeds the limits just described, then the employee must include in income the *greater* of (a) the excess of the cost of the award over the amount allowable as a deduction (but not more than the award’s value), or (b) the excess of the value of the award over the amount allowable as a deduction. If the employer’s cost is *not* over the applicable limit, the employee may exclude the award regardless of its value.

After the 1986 law there would no longer be any need to make the subjective determination as to whether the employee award is a gift. No employee awards will be treated as gifts for income tax purposes.

### 21 Interest on State and Municipal Obligations

You can exclude from gross income all interest earned on obligations of a state, territory, municipality, or any political subdivision, except in the case of arbitrage bonds issued after October 9, 1969.

==If you are in a sufficiently high tax bracket, the advantages of purchasing a state or municipal bond can be substantial.== If you are in a 25 percent bracket, a 6½ percent yield on a municipal obligation is the equivalent of a 8.67 percent yield on a nonexempt security. Moreover, the risk factor on a state or municipal obligation will normally be far lower than that on an industrial security. The higher the tax bracket, the greater the attraction of a tax-exempt security.

### 22 Public Assistance Payments

Benefit payments from a general welfare fund in the interest of the general public, such as payments to aid the indigent or the blind, or payments to crime victims, are excludable from your gross income. These welfare payments have been excluded by the Internal Revenue Service, because the IRS sees them in the nature of gifts.

### 23 Social Security and Other Retirement Benefits

Social Security benefits under the federal Social Security programs may not be taxable. Social Security benefits received from foreign countries, however, are taxable unless they are specifically exempt by treaty.

Moreover, basic Medicare benefits received under the Social Security Act are also excluded from gross income since they are considered Social Security payments. So also are supplementary benefits covering costs of doctors’ services and other items not covered under basic Medicare, as they are in the nature of medical insurance payments.

Note, however, that since January 1, 1984, part of your Social Security benefits have been subject to tax if your income exceeded a specified level determined by formula. There are three factors used in determining how much of your Social Security benefits, if any, will be included in taxable income: 

1. Your income, defined as your adjusted gross income for federal income tax plus any tax-exempt interest, plus any foreign source income you receive during the year; 
2. Your half-benefit, defined as half the Social Security income you (and, if you’re married and filing jointly, your spouse) receive during the year; and 
3. Your base amount, which is $25,000 for a single taxpayer, ==$32,000 for a married couple filing jointly==, and zero for a married couple filing separately (unless they have lived apart for the entire tax year, in which case they qualify for the $25,000 base amount).


Effective after December 31, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 created a second tier of Social Security benefit inclusion in gross income. For taxpayers with *income* above these amounts, the amount included in income shall be the *lesser* of:

1. 85 percent of your total Social Security benefit, or
2. the sum of:
  - the smaller of (i) the amount included under prior law; or (ii) $4,500 (if unmarried) or $6,000 (if married filing jointly)
  - 85 percent of the excess of your *income* over the new applicable second tier threshold amounts ($34,000 and **$44,000**).

If your income, modified as above, is over the upper threshold up to 85 percent or your Social Security benefits may be taxed. **Between the base amount and the upper threshold, only 50 percent would be taxed. **



### 25 Sale of Your Home

You may exclude from your gross income some or all of your gain from the sale or exchange of your main home, if you meet certain ownership and use tests at the time of the sale or exchange.

*Prior to May 7, 1997,* you could have expected to exclude from your gross income $125,000 (the maximum allowable) of gain on the sale or exchange of your main home *if:*

- you were age 55 or older before the date of the sale or exchange;
- you owned and lived in the property sold or exchanged as your main home for at least three years out of the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange; *and*
- you or your spouse never excluded gain on the sale or exchange of a home after July 20, 1981.

These rules were *all* changed by the Tax Relief Act of 1997. *After May 6, 1997* joint filers can exclude, as often as every 2 years, as much as $500,000 ($250,000 for single filers) in gain on the sale of a principal residence occupied for 2 of the 5 years prior to sale. To qualify, ==you must have used the house as your principal residence for at least 2 out of the 5 years prior to the sale==. However, the exclusion will be available once every 2 years, although there are exceptions to that rule too. Those close to retirement or whose children have moved out may be big winners here. They can now sell their old, big houses without the need to reinvest in new, more expensive homes to avoid taxation on the gains. They can now buy smaller residences, or even rent. The prior law provision under Section 1034 that deferred taxation upon a rollover of the sales proceeds into a new home has been repealed.

You can get a partial exclusion based on the time of use and ownership, but only if the sale is required because of a *change in place of employment, health reasons, or unforeseen circumstances.* The IRS has been very flexible in defining “unforeseen circumstances.” Even the birth of twins or the hostility of neighbors (PLR 200403049) will now qualify.

Unfortunately, the 1997 law was unclear if you owned the property for less than 2 years. The 1998 Act provided the answer. It provides partial relief based on a fraction of the *maximum exclusion,* rather than on the basis of your actual realized profit.

For example, assume you bought a house in 2016 for $250,000 and sell it in 2017 for a $25,000 profit. Because you are married, and lived there 1 year, you are eligible for half the $500,000 exclusion you would have been entitled to had you been there the full 2 years. Half the exclusion is $250,000, greater than the gain of $25,000, and therefore none of your gain is taxable. Had the alternative interpretation applied, you would have been able to exclude half your profit, and paid tax on the remaining $12,500.

Not everybody wins on this one. Miss Fortune bought her home in 2016 for $1.5 million and sold it 1 year later for a $400,000 profit. Since she is single and lived there only half the required 2 years, she gets to exclude $125,000, and pay tax on $275,000 of her gain. Had the alternative interpretation applied, she would have excluded half her $400,000 gain and only paid taxes on $200,000. Note that any “nonqualifying use,” such as a rental, reduces your exclusion.

There is no age requirement for this exclusion and ==the exclusion can be claimed every 2 years==. However, if you have a $250,000/$500,000 gain every 2 years, I want to meet your real estate broker!

### 26 Carpool Receipts

If you form a carpool to carry passengers to and from work, the amounts received from these passengers are not included in your income. These amounts are considered reimbursement for transportation expenses incurred.

### 28 Damages

Damages received in settlement of a lawsuit or awarded by a court were normally excluded from income under the return of capital doctrine. Theoretically, damages awarded for personal wrong committed against you (for instance, breach of promise to marry, invasion of privacy, libel, slander, alienation of affection) replace the personal capital destroyed by these wrongful acts. Defamation awards were also excludable.[6](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/how-to-pay/9781260115819/ch04.xhtml#ch04fn_6) Amounts received as damages for personal injury were excludable under both this doctrine and specific congressional mandate.[7](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/how-to-pay/9781260115819/ch04.xhtml#ch04fn_7) However, damages received as a substitute for income are generally taxable, since they represent a restoration of lost wages or profits that would have been taxable upon receipt.

### 29 Life Insurance

==Life insurance proceeds paid to you because of the death of the insured are not taxable== unless the policy was purchased by you or transferred to you for a price. This is true even if the proceeds are paid under an accident or health insurance policy or an endowment contract.

### 30 Qualified State Tuition (529) Programs

Current law provides tax-exempt status to “Qualified State Tuition Programs.” These are programs established by a state or a state agency under which you can (1) purchase tuition credits or certificates for the payment of education expenses or (2) make contributions into an account established to pay qualified education expenses, such as tuition, books, and fees, and for 2009, 2010, and 2015 forward, computers and computer technology.

The interest or other earnings from such accounts comes out federal and state tax-free! Several states (e.g., New York) have programs where you don’t even have to go to school in that state to qualify. All 50 states have such a program. Following are some of the best. Don’t miss this tax-advantaged way to finance your kid’s college expenses.

Or, you can get really creative. Name yourself as beneficiary of a Section 529 account and save money for a 2- or 3-year sabbatical—tax-free as long as it involves education at an eligible institution! Not only can you use the money for books and tuition, but you can even pay for your apartment up to the amount specified in school guidelines.

As an alternative, check out the *Independent 529 Plan.* It lets you lock in current tuition rates at more than 200 private colleges.

It works like this. Suppose you contribute $10,000. Assume that’s 50 percent of one year’s tuition at school “x.” When you or your child enrolls, you’ve got 50 percent of one year’s tuition paid.

The deals vary per college. But the money invested grows tax free. If you don’t go, you get a refund, plus or minus two percentage points each year, depending on how your investments fared.



### 31 Your Home 

The Mother of All Tax Shelters!

Want to invest in a tax shelter that puts a roof over your head? ==There are more tax advantages and exclusions with respect to your home than any other investment. It’s the American way—Mom, apple pie, and owning your own home.== Let’s look at all the deductions and benefits you get when you pay homage to the mortgage gods and go into more debt than your parents earned in their lifetimes.

#### Tax

First, you get to deduct all the real property taxes you pay. That includes all state or local taxes for the general welfare. It does not count any trash or garbage collection fees, or homeowner association charges specifically stated and billed.

==There is no limit on the number of properties on which you can deduct taxes paid. If you have 10 homes, you can deduct the taxes on all 10.==

#### Interest

==Interest paid on the purchase of your principal residence is deductible.== You can even finance the buy of additional land adjacent to your home and deduct the interest as qualified residence interest. You can also deduct the interest you pay to buy a second residence or vacation home.

There is a cap of one million dollars of acquisition indebtedness on which you can take a personal interest deduction. If you plan on spending more than $1 million for your house, call me and we will work something out.

You can also deduct the interest on as much as $100,000 worth of home equity debt. As long as the house has the equity and the debt is secured by that equity, the IRS does not care what you do with the borrowed money. You can use it for whatever you want, including vacations, or a party to celebrate your newfound deductions.

If you are in the 25 percent bracket, that means that $100 in interest paid only takes $75 out of your pocket. Uncle Sam pays the other $25 in income taxes foregone. Not a bad deal!

#### Gain Exclusion

If you qualify under the 2 out of 5 rule, you normally sign an affidavit at settlement. If the house sold for less than $250,000/$500,000, the sale amount is not even reported to the IRS because you have no tax liability on that sale.

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 changed the rules again. Prior to the Act, if a second home became a principal residence, after 2 years the owner could sell it and exclude up to $250,000 in gain from income—or up to $500,000 for couples filing jointly. Now, gain from the sale of a principal residence home will no longer be excluded from gross income for periods that the home was not used as the principal residence (“nonqualifying use”). This new income inclusion rule applies to home sales after December 31, 2008, and is based only on nonqualified use periods that begin on or after January 1, 2009. ==A period of absence (for example, vacations) generally counts as qualifying use if it occurs after the home was used as the principal residence.==

The rental period (2010–2011) is nonqualifying use. All use post-December 31, 2011, qualifies, including 2014 when you moved out. You owned the property a total of 5 years (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014). Forty percent of the gain (2 years out of 5 owned) or $128,000 is taxable. The $20,000 gain attributable to depreciation is recaptured at rates as high as 25 percent. Up to $192,000 in gain can still be excluded.

#### Home Offices

Let’s assume you use 20 percent of your house as a home office. In the past, when you sold your house, 20 percent of the gain wouldn’t qualify for the exclusion because that 20 percent wasn’t used as a “residence.” It was used exclusively as your office.

**New Rule**—The IRS doesn’t care! ==Even if you used your home 90 percent for business, as a home office, you can now exclude as much as 100 percent of your gain==, up to the $250,000/$500,000 limit!

### 34 Unemployment Benefits

For 2009 only, The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 made the first $2,400 in unemployment benefits received, per recipient, tax-free.

### 43 ABLE Accounts

The Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act of 2014 created a tax-favored savings account for people under the age of 26 who are blind or disabled.  

## Credits
Dollar-for-Dollar Tax Reductions



### 44 The Earned Income Credit

==Certain eligible low-income workers== are entitled to claim a refundable credit on their income tax returns. The amount of the credit an eligible individual may claim depends upon whether the individual has one, more than one, or no qualifying children and is determined by multiplying the credit rate by the taxpayer’s earned income up to an earned income amount. The maximum amount of the credit is the product of the credit rate and the earned income amount. 

### 52 Adoption Assistance

The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 provided taxpayers with a maximum nonrefundable credit against income tax liability of $5,000 per child ($6,000 in the case of special needs adoptions) paid or incurred by the taxpayer. Any unused adoption credit may be carried forward by the taxpayer for up to five years. Qualified adoption expenses are reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney’s fees, and other expenses that are directly related to the legal adoption of an “eligible child.”

In the case of an international adoption, the credit is not available unless the adoption is finalized. Credits for domestic adoptions are earned when the expenses are paid—even if the adoption failed. An “eligible child” is an individual 

1. who has not attained age 18 as of the time of the adoption, or 
2. who is physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself or herself. No credit is allowed for expenses incurred
  - in violation of state or federal law, 
  - in carrying out any surrogate parenting arrangement, or 
  - in connection with the adoption of a child of the taxpayer’s spouse. 


The credit was phased out ratably for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income a bove $75,000 and ==is fully phased out at $115,000 of modified adjusted gross income==.

### 56 Child Tax Credit

Present law provides a $1,000 tax credit for each qualifying child under the age of 17. Your child becomes 17 on the anniversary of his or her date of birth (Rev. Rul. 2003-72). A qualifying child is one you claim as a dependent. The credit may be partially refundable using Form 8812 even if you only have one child.

==The credit is phased out on a joint return earning more than $110,000== and for singles earning more than $75,000. For every $1,000 or part thereof earned, the credit is reduced by $50. If you have only one qualifying child, for a joint return earning more than $129,000, the credit would have been eliminated completely.

### 59 Saver's Credit

In order to stimulate savings, Congress gives you **a credit of up to 50 percent on the first $2,000 you sock away in a traditional or Roth IRA or 401(k)**. So if you contribute $2,000, you’ll get a $1,000 credit. That’s in addition to the minimum $200 that the $2,000 deduction will save you in taxes (at the 10 percent bracket).

Unfortunately, to get the 50 percent credit, ==your adjusted gross income can’t be more than $18,500==. If you then subtract a $4,050 personal exemption and a $6,300 standard deduction, your taxable income is capped at $8,150. **The maximum tax on that is $815, not the $1,000 promised by Congress**.


### 66 First-Time Home Buyer Credit

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 gave first-time home buyers a refundable tax credit of 10 percent of the purchase price, up to $7,500 ($3,750 for married people filing separately). The credit began to ==phase out at the $150,000 adjusted gross income level for joint filers== ($75,000 for other filers) and was not available for joint filers with income above $170,000 ($95,000 for other filers). It also was not available to nonresident aliens, those who qualified for a similar District of Columbia credit, or those whose financing came from tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. The credit was effective for homes purchased on or after April 9, 2008, and before July 1, 2009. But this credit must be paid back, in equal installments for 15 years. So if you got the full $7,500, you’d pay an additional “tax” of $500 each year. Payments start 2 years after the year in which the residence is purchased or earlier, if you sell the house or if it is no longer your principal residence. You qualify as a “first-time home buyer” if neither you nor your spouse had any ownership interest in a principal residence during the 3-year period before the new home is purchased. The best news: is that if you die, you don’t have to pay back the credit.

### 67 "Making Work Pay" Tax Credit

This provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 cut taxes for more than 95 percent of working families in the United States. For 2009 and 2010, the provision provided a refundable tax credit of up to $400 for working individuals and $800 for working families. This refundable tax credit was calculated at a rate of 6.2 percent of earned income, and phased out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income in excess of $75,000** (==$150,000 for married couples filing jointly==). You could receive this benefit through a reduction in the amount of income tax that was withheld from your paycheck, or through claiming the credit on your tax return using Schedule M.



## "Above the Line"Deductions

Our tax system is founded on a multistep computation. You begin with gross income. This is all income, all accession to wealth, clearly realized, over which you have dominion, less those items defined earlier as tax exclusions. From gross income you then subtract a certain category of expenses called by tax practitioners *adjustments* or *above the line deductions.* A deduction is a reduction of your taxable income—the income base on which your tax is imposed. *Above the line deductions* include trade and business deductions, alimony, moving expenses, student-loan interest, self-employment, tuition tax deduction, IRA, Keogh, and SEP deductions, certain education expenses, the deduction for contributions to a health savings account, and employee business expenses of performing artists.

Gross income less adjustments (*above the line deductions*) gives your adjusted gross income. From adjusted gross income, you then subtract the greater of your itemized deductions (*below the line deductions*) or your standard deduction. The standard deduction is basically similar to the old zero bracket amount. It is different from the zero bracket amount in that it is a deduction from adjusted gross income and not a tax bracket.

### 76 Trade and Business Deductions

All “ordinary and necessary expenses” paid or incurred by you during your taxable year in carrying on any trade or business are allowed as above the line deductions.

Here it is very important to understand that the words “ordinary and necessary” are words of art. For an expense to be deductible, it need not be absolutely necessary in the sense that you cannot conduct your trade without incurring such an expense. The courts have interpreted the words “ordinary and necessary” to mean “reasonable and customary,” and this interpretation has been accepted by the Internal Revenue Service. Therefore, any expenses that you might incur in your business that are reasonable and customary for that business, even if not in any sense necessary, are deductible.

This provides you with an excellent opportunity to convert what would normally be nondeductible personal expenses into deductible business expenses. For example, assume that you have your own trade or business in New York and want to take a vacation in Miami. Alternatively, you could live in Miami and want to vacation in California. Almost all businesses have professional associations or trade groups who conduct seminars or hold meetings in resort areas. If you could schedule your vacation in these areas at the same time as the professional meeting and attend that professional meeting, your travel expenses, would be converted from personal expenses into allowable, deductible business expenses. While attendance at these conventions or trade shows might not be necessary to your business, it would be reasonable and customary. Later in the book I will discuss more of these extensive tax advantages for those who own their own businesses.

### 79 Alimony

Certain payments that constitute “alimony” may be taken as above the line deductions by the payer. Such alimony payments may be made from husband to wife or from wife to husband. 

### 80 Interest on Qualified Education Loans

Interest paid on qualified education loans was deductible above the line for payments made during the first 60 months in which payments are required. After December 31, 2001, the 60-month limit is eliminated.

### 81 Retirement Plan Payments

####  ROTH IRA

The second kind of IRA is the *Roth IRA*. Here, contributions will not be deductible but, if the IRA is held for at least 5 years (the 5-year period starts on the first day of the year for which a contribution is made or in which the first conversion contribution is made) and the account holder is at least 59½ years old, then all withdrawals will be tax-free! Moreover, more people will be eligible to fund these accounts. The 2017 income limits phased out at from $118,000–$133,000 for single taxpayers and ==from $186,000–$196,000 for couples. However, the combined contributions to these two types of accounts are limited to $5,500 per year for each taxpayer.==

#### myRA - A Really Simple Retirement Account

Former President Obama asked the U.S. Department of the Treasury to develop a *my*RA (“My Retirement Account”) program, offering a new retirement savings account for individuals looking for a simple, safe, and affordable way to start saving. Savers will be able to open an account with as little as $25 and contribute $5 or more every payday. *my*RA balances will never go down, and there will be no fees. *my*RAs will be initially offered through employers and will be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.

*my*RAs will be Roth IRA accounts available to anyone who has an annual income of less than $131,000 a year for individuals and $193,000 for couples. *my*RAs will be for savers who either do not have access to an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan or are looking to supplement a current plan. They will be designed for savers who want an investment with a low opening amount.

*my*RAs will earn interest at the same variable rate as the Government Securities Investment Fund in the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees. Savers may voluntarily roll over *my*RAs to private-sector retirement accounts at any time. Once a saver’s *my*RA reaches $15,000, or after 30 years, the balance will be rolled over to a private-sector retirement account. The Treasury will finalize rollover procedures when it launches the *my*RA program later this year.

Once the accounts are available, employees of participating employers will start by signing up for *my*RA online. Then they will set up an initial automatic payroll direct deposit with their employers for a minimum contribution of $25. Employees will then elect to have a portion of their paychecks—as little as $5—directly deposited into their *my*RAs automatically every payday.

*my*RAs will be free and easy for employers to offer. Employers may distribute *my*RA information but will not administer employee accounts or contribute to them. On payday, employers will send a direct deposit to each participating employee’s *my*RA.

### 84 Moving Expenses

Moving expenses incurred if you change job locations or if you start a new job are generally deductible if you meet certain requirements. For moves made after 1993, your new job location must be at least 50 miles from your former job location, you must make your move within 1 year from the date you start your new job, and you must work full-time for a specified period of time. For moves in 1994 or after, expenses are above the line deductions. (Pre-1994, the mileage was 30 miles and the expenses were itemized deductions.)

### 85 Clean Fuel Vehicles

If you were the original owner, you could have gotter a deduction of up to $2,000 of the cost of a clean fuel vehicle. That’s a vehicle that uses a significant source of energy other than gasoline.

You got the $2,000 deduction if the car was placed in service in 2004 or 2005. Now, you’ll use the Hybrid Vehicles Credits

### 86 Deduction for Qualified Higher Education Expenses

In 2002 and 2003, if you had an adjusted gross income that did not exceed $65,000 (==$130,000 in the case of married couples filing joint returns==) you were entitled to a maximum deduction of $3,000 per year.

### 90 Health Savings Accounts

A high-deductible health plan is one with an annual deductible of not less than $1,300 ($1350 for 2018) for individual coverage and not less than $2,600 ($2,700 for 2018) for family coverage. That means you pay for the routine medical visits, tests, eyeglasses, and the like. Remember, the bigger the deductible, the smaller the premium you have to pay.

In addition, the sum of the annual deductible and other out of pocket expenses required to be paid under the plan can’t exceed $6,550 for 2017 ($6,900 for 2018) for individual coverage, and ==$13,100 for 2017 ($13,300 for 2018) for family coverage==.

Technically, the HSA is a trust. You can now (2017) contribute to that trust and *take a tax deduction of* $3,400 ($6,750 with family coverage). ==For 2018, the numbers are reset to $3,450 and $6,900.==

==If you’re age 55 or older, you can make additional $1,000 deductible contributions.==

You can dip into this pot at any time. Any dollars used for medical expenses come out tax-free. You can use the HSA for routine doctor visits, lab tests, eyeglasses, dental care, or even cosmetic surgery. Anything left over at the end of the year rolls back into the pot. So, **if you’re young and healthy, you could built up a nice pot of cash in case of major medical problems years later.**

You can’t use your HSA to buy health insurance. But, payments for long-term care insurance count. You can also use the money for temporary health insurance while you’re unemployed and collecting unemployment, or for COBRA continuation insurance.

The one downside is that you can no longer make additional HSA contributions once you sign up for Medicare, but you still can make withdrawals.



## "Below the Line" Deductions

Your filing status is determined on the last day of each year. This affords you another opportunity for sophisticated tax planning. The rates for married individuals, filing either jointly *or* separately, are much lower than those for single, unmarried taxpayers. For example, for 2017, on taxable income of $91,900, a single person pays a marginal tax rate of 28 percent and a total tax of $18,714. On the other hand, a married taxpayer with a spouse who has no income would pay a marginal rate of only 25 percent and a total tax of $14,453. If you are ==planning a New Year’s wedding, advancing it only a few days to Christmas would therefore save you $4,261—enough to pay for your honeymoon==.

Alternatively, if both married partners work, there is, in effect, a tax on the marriage. In 2017, two individuals earning $91,900 in taxable income would each pay $18,714 in taxes for a total outlay of $37,428. If they got married before the year-end, their total income would be $183,800, and they would have filed either a joint return or a return as married, filing separately—either way mandating a total tax payment of $38,349, $921 more than what they would have paid had they remained unmarried!

There are a number of general strategies that should be implemented when planning for your itemized deductions. The most important of these is the timing of your deductions. Many deductions can be shifted from one year to the next.

You might want to implement such shifting if your itemized deductions are close to the standard deduction amount. Your aim should be to bunch your deductions for expenses so that they exceed the full value of your standard deduction amount. For example, assume that you have itemized deductions of $12,700 each year, of which $3,000 can be accelerated or deferred. With a standard deduction amount of $12,700, none of these deductions would be allowed as excess. What you do, therefore, is to time the expenses you can control so as to itemize deductions of $15,700 in the alternate years ($12,700 + $3,000). This strategy allows you an extra deduction of $3,000 every second year, and if you are in the 28 percent bracket, it saves you $840 in taxes each time.

### 92 Medical Expenses

You may deduct certain medical and dental expenses not only for yourself but for your spouse and your dependents as well. Medical expenses are payments that you make for the diagnosis, cure, relief, treatment, or prevention of disease. They also include payments for treatment affecting any part or function of the body. Expenses for transportation for needed medical care are included in medical expenses. Payments for insurance that provide medical care for you, your spouse, and your dependents are also included in medical expenses.

There are certain limitations on the amount you may deduct. As of 2013, you may ==deduct only that part of your medical and dental expenses that is more than 10 percent of your adjusted gross income==.

For example, if you have a modified adjusted gross income of $45,000 and $5,475 of medical expenses, you would multiply $45,000 by 0.075 (7.5 percent) to find that only expenses exceeding $3,375 can be deducted. This leaves you with a medical expense deduction of $2,100 (5,475 - 3,375).

One of my own favorite medical deductions is the cost of an overseas trip for medical or dental work. For example, it has been established that the cost of extensive dental work is far less expensive in Europe than in the United States. Therefore, even adding the transportation costs to go to an overseas dentist, your total cash outlay is lower than having such work performed locally. On this basis, such transportation costs have been allowed as deductible medical expenses. One woman consulted three different dermatologists in the United States, but none was able to improve her skin condition. Finally, she was treated successfully as an outpatient in a foreign country. The IRS agreed that her expenses were deductible (Letter Ruling 812-6044).



## Traditional Tax Shelters

**The art of sophisticated tax planning requires you to understand the elements of tax-sheltered investments.** These investments allow you to offset certain “artificial losses”—noneconomic losses, but losses that are available as deductions under the present tax laws, and not only against the income from those investments but also against your other income from your regular business or professional activity.

There normally are three elements that make up the typical tax shelter arrangement. One or more of these elements will be found in almost all tax shelters. 

- The first is the *deferral concept,* in which deductions are accelerated in order to reduce the tax liability of an individual in the early years of the transaction instead of matching those deductions against the income that is eventually generated from the investment. This deferral of tax liability from the earlier years to the future years results, in effect, in an interest-free loan by the federal government, repayable when the investment either produces net taxable income, is sold, or is otherwise disposed of.
- The other element of a typical tax shelter is *leverage,* in which borrowed funds are used in a taxpayer’s investments to pay the expenses for which accelerated deductions are received. Your position is enhanced when the borrowing is on a nonrecourse basis, which means that you are not *personally* liable to repay loans and your personal investment risk is limited to your equity investment. Unfortunately, recent tax laws and Internal Revenue Service rulings have limited the availability of tax shelter investments with a nonrecourse-loan basis.
- A third tax shelter element for many investments is the *conversion* of ordinary income to capital gains at the time of the sale or other disposition of the investment. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a *maximum* 20 percent rate (23.8 percent in 2013 and after with the 3.8 percent surcharge on unearned income). For those in the 35 percent or lower brackets, the rate is not more than 15 percent. Conversion occurs when the portion of the gain reflecting the accelerated deductions taken against ordinary income is taxed as a capital gain. If you are in a lower income tax bracket in the later years, you effectively convert the tax rate as well.

### 117 Real Estate

*“It’d take a genius to invest in real estate and pay taxes”:* House Ways and Means Committee member Fortney H. (Pete) Stark, D-Calif., on the committee’s decisions regarding the taxation of real estate, 1986. Of the various forms of investments available to you that involve possible tax incentives, the most widely used is real estate. Historically, real estate has been sold as an investment for income and long-term gain, as well as a hedge against inflation. Real estate can be purchased in the form of shopping centers, warehouse net leases, apartment buildings, residential housing, and even raw land.

Leverage

: Leverage is the use of borrowed funds with the anticipation that the property will increase in value at a rate greater than the cost of borrowing, so that a profit will be realized not only on the investor’s own money but also on the use of someone else’s money. For example, if you make an investment of $100, putting up $10 in cash and borrowing $90 at an interest rate of 10 percent, at the end of the first year you will have a net cash outflow of $19 (your $10 initial investment plus $9 interest on the $90 borrowed). Assume your property increases in value 20 percent during that same period and then you sell it, paying off your $90 debt. You receive a total of $120; subtract the $99 ($90 in principal plus $9 in interest), and you have a net gain of $21. On your initial cash investment of $10, this represents a 210 percent return. You can often use borrowed capital in a real estate purchase to finance as much as 80 percent of the total cost of the property.

Inflation Hedge

: The supply of real estate is clearly limited. For this reason, many people believe that investments in well-selected real estate can be expected to at least keep up with inflation, and perhaps even increase in value faster than inflation.

Cash Flow

: In many cases, good income-producing real property will generate a favorable cash flow. This cash flow can be augmented by increased income tax savings due to the shelter aspects of real estate investments.

Equity Buildup

: Income-producing real estate may create increased liquidity. Debt reduction plus inflation may create equity that can be the source of new or additional financing. This is the amount of the mortgage principal that you are paying off each year. Even if the property value merely remains flat with no appreciation, your equity interest in that property will increase each year by the principal payoff.

Ability to Pool Capital

: Syndicates or partnerships enable investors to pool their capital in order to acquire large, select properties they would not be able to buy individually.

Deductible Expenses

: -  *Mortgage interest,* that portion of debt service payments represented by deductible interest costs.
  - *Depreciation,* an accounting adjustment that reflects the theoretical wear and tear and economic obsolescence of the property. It is the deduction for the investment you made—both borrowed and out of pocket. Because of this, a portion of the income you receive is considered a return of your capital investment and not subject to tax.
  - *Operating expenses,* which include property management, maintenance, insurance, garbage removal, real estate taxes, common area utilities, etc.
  - *Construction period expenses,* deductible expenses incurred before the building is occupied, such as real estate taxes, interest on the construction loan, etc. These costs are not deductible when incurred, but must be amortized over a period of years.
  - *Fees,* a portion of the purchase price that, frequently, the seller of the property agrees to take as payment for services, resulting in an immediate deduction—for instance, guarantees for “rent up,” completion, financing, etc.

Before investing in a shelter you must recognize that real estate projects fall into three major categories:

- Commercial
- Residential
- Government-supported housing

### 120 Equipment Leasing

Leasing, as a method of financing capital assets for industry, has grown tremendously in recent years and can be a good tax shelter. According to the National Association of Securities Dealers, **equipment leasing deals have been the fastest growing category of direct placement programs (tax shelters)**. Capital assets frequently financed by leasing include computers, airplanes, railroad rolling stock, ships, pollution control equipment, and industrial machinery.

### 121 Single-Premium Life Insurance

Single-premium policies may still be viable and desirable for other reasons. They provide a mechanism to pass assets to others without subjecting them to the costs, delays, and uncertainties of probate. Attacks on or elections against an insured’s will are avoided, as are any claims of potential creditors. Such policies also provide a way to fully prefund future debts or pledges with discounted tax-advantaged dollars. Moreover, at death they are still income tax-free and can be arranged to be both estate and inheritance tax-free.



### 124 Tax Straddles

To offset the short-term capital gain, you straddle a very volatile commodity (such as copper, silver, or pork bellies) near year-end, hoping for significant price movement—up *or* down—before December 31. If prices rise, you cover your short position at a loss; if prices fall, you liquidate the long position. Either way, the short-term capital loss from commodities offsets your short-term capital gain from other sources. After year-end you liquidate the profitable position. This moves your short-term gain into the next year or (depending on how you hold the contract) converts it to a long-term capital gain. According to former IRS Commissioner Jerome Kurtz, the worst that can happen is that you “receive the equivalent of an interest-free loan from the government for the period of deferral.” But if the price does not move, or if it turns around before you can liquidate the profitable position, you will have a loss.

Straddles can be used not only with commodities but with government securities, such as treasury bills, bonds, or “Ginnie Maes,” or with options on those securities as well. The objective is the same—to create a loss that will reduce your taxable income for one year while you also set the stage to cover that loss with a capital gain in the next year. If the year works out right, you get a current tax benefit and come close to breaking even on the transaction itself.

Treasury bills were a favorite vehicle for straddles because, unlike most securities, they are not classified as capital assets. Under tax rules, any gain or loss from the sale of Treasury bills was treated as ordinary income. These bills are sold at a discount of face value and appreciate to *par* (face value) at maturity. Because the bills are such safe collateral, margin requirements on these straddles are low, as little as 3 percent of the bills’ face value. The following example shows you how a Treasury bill straddle might have worked.

Assume that on December 17 you sell short $1 million in Treasury bills due December 26, and you buy $1 million in Treasury bills due the following March 26, which you intend to sell on January 2. The March maturity date allows for what is generally considered a reasonable period of market risk. But for purposes of this example, assume that between December 26 and January 2 interest rates are high. The result is that you don’t receive the full $1 million face value because the bills due December 26 have 9 days to go until maturity. Assuming a discount of 16.83 percent, the purchase price is $995,793. On the maturity date, you have to cover the sale of borrowed securities. This will cost $1 million, giving you a loss on the transaction of $4,027 for the year.

The $1 million in bills due March 26 that you buy after making the short sale have 99 days to maturity. Assuming a discount of 16.30 percent, the purchase price is $955,175. When you sell those bills on January 2, you collect $962,419, for a gain of $7,244.

After commission costs of approximately $1,200, the net economic gain on the two transactions is $1,837. This gain is reduced by any interest charges on a margin account. In terms of the tax deduction, the straddles saved an investor in the 50 percent bracket (including state, federal, and local taxes) $2,103.50 in taxes for the first year ($4,027 × .50).

Such commodity straddles appear to be no-lose situations. In fact, though, they may turn out to be no-win situations. The Internal Revenue Service views these transactions as “wholly tax motivated and without any real economic substance.” Internal Revenue Service staff members who screen and classify returns are being trained to recognize “straddle” returns and are targeting them for audit. According to the IRS, “taxpayers claiming tax benefits from these transactions will face a substantial likelihood of having their return selected for audit and their claims of artificial losses disallowed on examination.”



## Super Tax Shelters

The first rule of income taxation is that a tax liability for personal service income may not be avoided by the earner of that income by assignment or other transfer before the income is realized. If you perform services that earn monetary reward, that income will be taxed to you. The second law of income taxation, however, is that income earned from *property* belongs to the owner of that property. Therefore, **the first key to reducing your taxes is to transfer income-producing property to a family member in a lower bracket.** If you make a bona fide transfer of income-producing property that you own, you have effectively shifted all future income from that property. After the transfer, the future income and all income tax due on that income will belong to the new owner in the lower tax bracket.

Part of your solution to the problem of reducing your tax, therefore, is to get your current income taxed to lower-bracketed family members. This strategy is based on the premise that a family is an economic and social unit and that it is immaterial to the welfare of the family as a whole which member derives income or owns property. From a tax perspective, however, it is extremely material.

The standard deduction now permits the tax-free transfer of $1,050 of investment income to a child or other member of your family who has no other income. Alternatively, if the child is of sufficient age to work, that child can earn up to $11,850 ($6,350 standard deduction plus $5,500 IRA[*](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/how-to-pay/9781260115819/ch09.xhtml#ch09fn_s)) a year in income and still pay zero taxes. Remember, however, that the objective is not necessarily that the family member pay zero taxes, but rather that the taxes paid be less than what you would pay if the income were taxed directly to you. For example, even if that family member is in the 10 percent bracket, a shift of $1,000 in income from you in the 28 percent bracket would result in a net savings of $180.

The intent of the law is to create three stages:

**1.**  There will be no tax on the first $1,050 of unearned income because of the child’s standard deduction. The standard deduction for a dependent in 2017 is the greater of $1,050 in *unearned* income or the sum of $350 plus any *earned* income, with a total of $6,350.

**2.**  The next $1,050 of unearned income will be taxed to the child at the child’s bracket.

**3.**  Unearned income in excess of the first $2,100 will be taxed to the child at the appropriate parent’s rate.



It may appear that the advantage of shifting income was eliminated by the reduction in bracket spreads (until 1987 the spread from the top bracket of 50 percent to the bottom bracket of 11 percent was 39 percentage points, but now the spread is from 39.6 percent to 10 percent, a 29.6 percentage point difference). But this is an oversimplification. Once a child becomes 19, all earned and unearned income is potentially taxed at the child’s rate. So dropping $10,000 a year of income from the 39.6 percent bracket to the 10 percent bracket will save 29.6 percent per year of the amount of income shifted. In 10 years that amounts to $29,600 in tax savings!

If a child can be claimed as a dependent on a parent’s return, the child may not take a personal exemption. Furthermore, the child’s standard deduction is limited to the greater of (a) $1,050, or (b) the sum of $350 and the child’s earned income (limited to a maximum of that year’s standard deduction). This has forced more parents than ever to file tax returns for their children (children with more than $1,050 of unearned income will have to file income tax returns), those returns are more complicated than ever (and therefore the cost of filing the returns will be increased), and the taxes payable by children have risen precipitously.



### Outright Gifts

A gift of income-producing property to members of your family is perhaps the most common method of splitting income to gain a tax advantage. The simplest way to transfer money, tax-free, is by gifts in relatively small lumps. You can give an annual gift of $14,000 per person to any number of family members—$28,000 if the gift is made jointly with a spouse—without incurring any gift liability. In order to qualify for the $14,000 or the $28,000 exclusion in the year the gift is made, it must be a gift of a *present interest* (current benefit). A gift tax return is required for any gifts in excess of these amounts to any recipient in any year if the gift is one of a present interest. A gift tax return is required for a gift of any amount if it is of a future interest. A gift is a completed transfer of the entire legal and beneficial interest in the property given. There is no gift *tax paid* until you use up your annual $14,000 exclusion plus your $5.49 million lifetime exclusion.



### 136 The Schnepper Deep Shelter

Another alternative for shifting income to a lower-bracketed family member is to transfer rental property, excluding the building, to a trust for your children and rent the land back from the trust. The donor parent would still get all of the depreciation on the building, and the trust beneficiary children would be taxed on the lease rental income received. That lease rental income, however, would be a deductible investment expense by the parent. In effect, the parent would be paying lease rental income to the children, deducting that rent expense in the higher bracket and having it taxed to the children at the lower bracket. Moreover, this transfer of family wealth could take place without any gift tax consequences. In *Stanley J. Wolfe,* T.C. Memo 1984-446, this arrangement was validated with a sale leaseback of land to an irrevocable 10-year trust. The leaseback had a bona fide business purpose, and the lease payments were determined to be reasonable rent. Here again, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 would require the use of an irrevocable trust if this technique were to be used effectively.



### 140 Employing Members of the Family

If you are an individual business owner, a simple and effective method of splitting your income with a family member is to employ that family member in your business and pay compensation. The employment must be bona fide and the salary paid must be reasonable in relation to the services rendered. Even a young child can be compensated for the reasonable value of such services as cleaning your office, mailing your letters, or opening your mail. A 1982 tax court decision allowed a $1,200 deduction for a 7-year-old child who performed a variety of services—maintenance and office work—for a mobile-home-park operator.[29](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/how-to-pay/9781260115819/ch09.xhtml#ch09fn_29) Be aware, however, that wages actually used by your children for their own support can affect your claim for their dependency exemptions. When in doubt, have your children bank their wages, thereby saving the exemption and teaching them the virtue of thrift as well.

## Investment Planning to Save Taxes

The first key to investment planning for 2017 tax purposes is finding out the ever-changing status of the capital gains tax on sales of capital assets. Capital assets include such things as stock, securities, real estate held as an investment, and most properties held for personal purposes.

### Short Sales
