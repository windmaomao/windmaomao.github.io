# The Crack-up

> The big problems of life seemed to solve themselves, and if the business of fixing them was difficult, it made one too tired to think of more general problems. 



> To go back to my thesis that  life has a varying offensive, the realization of having cracked was not simultaneous with a blow, but with a reprieve.
