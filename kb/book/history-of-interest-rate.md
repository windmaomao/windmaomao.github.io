# History of Interest Rate

> The cultural level of a nation is mirrored by its rate of interest: the highter a people's intelligence and moral strength, the lower the rate of interest.

He was speaking of free market rates of interest, not of controlled rates of interest. 

It seems fair to say, however, that the free market long-term rates of interest for any industrial nation, properly charted, provides a sort of fever chart of the economic and political health of that nation. Wars and political and economic calamities are recognizable at sight on the charts.

The impetus for this unprecedented result was a major cut in tax rates in the early 1980’s, a policy initiative
of the Reagan administration, without corresponding cuts in government spending. As a result of these deficits, federal debt in the hands of the public increased from $344 billion in 1974 to $709 billion in 1980
and to $2200 billion in 1989.

#### Short Term Interest Rates: 1946 - 1989

Although short-term and long-term rates generally move together over long periods of time, with the amplitude of short-rate movements typically exceeding that of long rates, there are some interesting excep-
tions. In the late 1980’s, for example, short-term rates moved up rather sharply compared to long-term rates, narrowing the long-short spread. The Federal Reserve battled inflation by keeping short rates relatively high; to some extent its success in this battle was evident in moderate to declining long rates.

The new “era” began quietly enough in 1965 with a continued rise in short-term interest rates, which carried three-month Treasury bills from 3.81% up to 4.47%. The Federal Reserve was exerting mild pressure, and the discount rate had been raised from 3.50 to 4% in late 1964. Never- theless, bond yields remained almost unchanged until late in the year. Then suddenly the market collapsed, led by a sharp decline in the bell- wether, the recently issued Treasury 41⁄4s of 1987–1992. New utility yields rose from 4.40 to 4.90%, and long government yields rose from 4.22 to 4.50%, thus exceeding their 1959 peak yields. Market psychology, which had clung to traditional benchmarks, was shattered, and the stage was set for a major bear market.
