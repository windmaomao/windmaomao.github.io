### Risk of Financial Distress

With the definition of financial distress behind us, let’s now turn to the associated concept of risk of financial distress, that is, how likely are you or your family to actually enter into a state of financial distress? Factors to be considered in assessing how likely you are to be put into financial distress include the following:

- Are you a single or dual income household?
- How stable or volatile is your income stream or streams?
How likely is it that you (or your spouse) will lose your job for any reason?
- If you (or your spouse) lose your job, how long would it take to replace that income?
- If there is a national severe recession or depression or other financial crisis, how likely is it to directly impact your job(s) and income stream(s)?
- If there is a severe recession or depression or other financial crisis, what will its likely impact be on you and your family?
- How much wealth—how big a cushion—do you ultimately have in reserve?
- How likely are you to be affected by uninsurable or noninsured natural disasters?
- Are there others relying on you and your income—children, parents, and so on—who might suddenly have extreme financial needs that you would feel morally or ethically compelled to assist with?

Unfortunately, there is little you can do to directly change your risk of financial distress, other than perhaps preparing for an alternative career or job—and a place to live and a way to be healthy and happy—if you lose your current position, your income stream falters, or your costs go up dramatically.

### The Four Indebted Strengths
A First Look {.subtitle}

This brings us to the four key qualities or Indebted Strengths that flow from the strategic use of debt:

1. Increased Liquidity—having more ready access to liquid funds or cash.
2. Increased Flexibility—having more options for addressing the direct and indirect costs of financial distress and for moderating the level of impact.
3. Increased Leverage—in good times, you have the ability to enhance and accelerate the accumulation of wealth.
4. Increased Survivability—a diminished likelihood that real survival issues, to your way of life or to life itself, will arise.

The bottom line is that the costs (direct and indirect), the level of impact, and the duration of financial distress can all be diminished by becoming aware of and taking advantage of your Indebted Strengths.

### The One Thing You Must Consider!

To help bring these ideas home and make them more concrete, let’s consider an example, which also just happens to be the one thing you should consider doing once you have been exposed to the ideas in this book. As Chapter 4 will discuss in detail, if you have at least several hundred thousand dollars in after-tax funds invested in a diversified portfolio, you are probably eligible for ==a portfolio-based or assets-based loan facility—an ABLF—==to be put into place.

Generally, the greater the amount you have invested and pledged, the better the interest rate you’ll get, and typically the rate you can get on an ABLF will be among the lowest cost source of funds available to you. While getting a good or great rate is often possible, as the case studies will illustrate, what is even more important is the flexibility and cushion it can provide you in a wide variety of circumstances.

Now, if you have a line of credit in place and a natural disaster strikes, or if you lose your job, or if an emergency operation that is not covered by insurance arises, guess what? You will have a substantial, immediate, liquid cushion that increases your flexibility generally and lets you address whatever real-time needs have arisen. If this disaster would have otherwise put you into a long period of financial distress, that duration will be shortened, and there’s a good chance the ABLF will keep you at or below the moderate financial stress impact level.
