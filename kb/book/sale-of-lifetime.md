### The Single Greatest Economic Force the World Has Ever Seen

### The Greatest Debt and Financial Bubble in History

Ultra-low interest rates have pushed up stocks or bonds to overvalued and unaffordable levels (and they continue to do so). When interest rates fall, the value of bonds, especially longer term ones, rises. Stocks are not just valued on 10 years’ forecast of earnings. Those earnings are discounted back to present-day value through the risk-free, 10-year Treasury bond rate. So the lower the rate, the higher today’s value of those future earnings . . . and the higher the value of stocks. Does this sound like something for nothing to you?

Yet, people don’t get it. They just don’t see it. And when I try to convince them we’re at the end of the greatest bubble known to modern man, they argue with me. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard: 

> “Stocks aren’t yet as highly valued as they were at the top of the tech bubble in early 2000.” 

No. They’re not. But then we’re also **not** in a positive geopolitical trend where the world is **easy-go-lucky** and news of terrorist attacks and brutal civil wars are uncommon.

The trouble is, central banks are desperate to avoid a massive reset on their watch. That’s why they’re the loudest voices in the “no-bubble” chorus. It’s also why they’ve gone to extremes to prevent the inevitable.

The last debt bubble anywhere close to this developed from 1914 into 1929 in the U.S. when we were the emerging country of that era. 

> The last debt bubble anywhere close to this developed from 1914 into 1929 in the U.S. when we were the emerging country of that era. 

Despite the widespread fear of inflation—and hyperinflation many worried so desperately about—the country has been able to eke out only 2% growth, with the first quarter of 2016 plunging down to 0.5%. Looks to me like we’re heading into a recession again, as we forecast. 

> **All of that money didn’t lead to inflation because it’s been fighting deflation.** 

As you can see, the Geneva Report broke down financial assets into several groups. The ones to pay particular attention to are stocks, financial sector bonds, and loans. They are the most vulnerable to deleveraging. 

So are central banks going to print $70 trillion this time around to save the financial institutions? Will they have any credibility when the first $8 trillion ended up succeeding only in inflating bigger bubbles that burst even harder with an even deeper economic collapse? 

> **It took 24 years for the Dow Jones to get back to its late-1929 high and 25 years to get back to its late-1968 high, adjusted for inflation.** 

That means, at a minimum, $87.5 trillion to $100 trillion is just going to disappear in the next several years, much of it in short order. You don’t need to be a genius to know that’s going to hurt! 

Another report worth noting is the Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report 2014 from the Financial Stability Board. It focuses on financial assets in 20 major countries and the Eurozone, but with more emphasis on shadow bank financial assets around the world. This sector tends to lend to the riskiest projects, have the greatest leverage, and hence deleverage the fastest. They’re also less likely to receive government assistance during a crisis. 

The fastest rising sectors - those of most concern - have been:

1. **Shadow banking**, now at $75 trillion and 120% global GDP,
2. **Insurance and pension funds**, at $53 trillion, and
3. **Central banks**, at $24 trillion

This group - the most vulnerable of the lot - totaled $152 trillion in 2013. It's closer to $170 trillion by now.

Central banks hold only 7.9% of the total global financial assets, which means they don’t have nearly the power they claim. Even if they doubled their assets in an attempt to fight this coming round of deleveraging and deflation, it wouldn’t even scratch the surface of the other $280 trillion worth of financial assets out there. In fact, just a 10% deleveraging in the private sectors would offset all central bank money printing and assets around the world. 

### Total U.S. Debt Is at Crusing Heights

2008 should have been the end of the debt bubble. Unfortunately, massive monetary and fiscal stimulus didn’t allow that. Instead, they spooned more cocaine to the crack addict by the shovelful. 

Corporate debt rose by 10.4%, as companies have borrowed $3 trillion since 2009 to buy back their stocks and artificially inflate their earnings per share with nearly free money courtesy of the Fed. 

When the next downturn arrives, during late 2016, I reasonably expect to see 40% declines in real estate and financial assets and a 50% decline in consumer debt, which consists mostly of mortgages. We could see 70% to 80% declines in the stock market early into the next decade, with most of that likely coming in the next few years. 

#### How It All Ends

Remember, banks don’t lend real money to people that they raise from investors. They pledge 10% of their deposits against those loans and they tend to have around 10% in capital to back those 10% deposit pledges up. That’s not much when real estate can fall by 26%, as it did in the U.S. in the early 1930s, or by 65%, is it did in Japan in recent decades. That’s not much when other financial assets can fall even more, like U.S. stocks plunging 89% into 1932 and 80% in Japan at the early-2009 lows. 

That’s how banks suddenly become insolvent. Their losses eat up their deposits after their small capital base is exhausted and they suddenly can’t give people their money back. 

#### Deflation Always Follows Deleveraging

Debt bubbles create deflation when they finally deleverage. **Money and wealth are destroyed, leaving fewer dollars to chase the same goods.** That is the textbook definition of deflation and what the gold bugs that call for hyperinflation from unprecedented money printing don’t understand. And it’s why we only managed to eke out 2% inflation on average since 2009, despite the trillions in Fed stimulus. 

>  **We'll endure deflation instead of low inflation.**

#### Do We Have Inflation or Defaltion? 

The answer is: both. We have inflation bubbles in some areas and deflationary trends in others. As the economic winter season progresses, and when this global debt and financial asset bubble bursts, deflation will become the dominant force. 

The extreme deflationary 1930s was way worse than the equally extreme inflationary 1970s. It’s the difference between **25% unemployment and 10%**, just by one measure. And don’t even talk about bank and business failures! 

But through an unprecedented effort to fight deflation, our monetary “wizards” have dragged the debt bubble out longer than it was ever meant to go. In fact, it has made the bubble so much worse than it was before they got involved. In their efforts to fight the tide, they’ve created a monster. 

#### It's Worth If You Are Rich

> Mark my words: **it won’t be too long before these inflationary bubbles in college tuition, healthcare, and childcare follow luxury goods over the edge of the deflationary cliff.** And they’ll have company. 

#### The Great Commodity Bust

>  Deflation is the trend going forward, not inflation. It has always been the hallmark of the winter economic season. 

#### The Winter of 2016-2022

The big question now is when we’ll see this deflation. It takes time, between 9 and 18 months for stimulus to move through the economy. That means the declining levels of stimulus through October 2014 will hit the economy in late 2015 and 2016, just as the baby boom moves into its steepest demographic slide after reaching age 54 in 2015. 

And should the Fed react to any new crisis by stimulating again, we won’t feel those effects fully until well into 2017. So watch out for deflation to accelerate throughout 2016 and most of 2017 into **at least early 2018**, right alongside major market crashes. 

All we need is a trigger . . . and there are many candidates vying for that honor . . .

- Biggest of the lot is the **unprecedented global debt and financial asset bubble** that has already begun to unwind. 
- Second is the **Red Dragon**, which I will discuss in more detail later. 
- And then there’s **the Eurozone**. **Germany** is in the midst of a major demographic drop—worse that what Japan saw in the 1990s—and it will increasingly feel the effects of that between now and 2022, while **Italy** is looking like the next Greece with rising bad loans . . . and it’s simply too big to bail out. 

Whichever trigger turns out to be the BIG one, watch out for a more serious downturn by the summer of 2016 and late 2016 at the latest. This will cause _sharp defaults in student loans and subprime auto loans_ ahead, which have both bubbled up. Fracking bonds will default like crazy. It will cause _a second and deeper decline in real estate_, putting more homes underwater in the years ahead than ever before. Companies will go bankrupt. Banks will be shaken to their core again. 

> It'll be nothing short of an implosion. And when it's done, we'll be ready to snap up the sales opportunities of a lifetime! 

### The Great China Bubble

The Chinese, just like the Soviets before them, are not performing many of the essential functions for which a state should be responsible. 

- They’re not representing the people and making sure that gains from capitalism pass down appropriately to the populace. 
- They’re not setting rules for the game of capitalism. 
- They’re not providing a legal system to enforce such rules, regulations, and fair play. 
- They’re not regulating things that can’t be taken into account by the free markets, like pollution (except just recently as they’ve been choking to death). 
- They’re not doing a lot of important things. 
- And where they are providing infrastructures for expansion, they are way overdoing that! 

Instead, they’re doing some very harmful things. And in so doing, they’ve created a bubble so big it could be the primary trigger that brings the world to its knees. 

> While extremely dangerous, it too is helping to make possible those once-in-a-lifetime opportunities we’ll be able to pick up, a dime for a dozen, over the next few years. 

#### Urbanization on Steroids

How could China’s stock market be so weak when it was the second-largest and fastest-growing country in the world? The answer is its government’s policy of overbuilding capacity in everything in an effort to accelerate growth and urbanization (i.e., a B.S. economy driven by top-down central planning). 

Overbuilding creates excess capacity with high fixed costs and debt service. That kills profits and that is what the stock market values most, not GDP growth. 

You can see that China’s government-driven investment boom has been more exaggerated and has lasted much longer than the export-driven expansions in Japan, South Korea, and Germany. In fact, it has grown twice the intensity for twice as long!

And the China’s overinvestment bubble is the greatest in modern history. As such, when it bursts it will be devastating, not only locally, but **globally** as well. And all investment bubbles burst, especially when debt and asset bubbles get so high they’re crushed by their own weight. It’s like adding grains of sand to a mound until one grain finally causes an avalanche!

#### A Population Aging Faster Than You'd Think

> A more free-market model would be to create growth in the economy and exports and then attract rural people into urban areas to fulfill those new jobs. 

China’s government-driven model is to build the urban areas first, then move people in from rural areas and hope to create jobs afterward so that the newly relocated people can become growing consumers. In other words, these new consumers are supposed to create the jobs for themselves by building stuff for no one and spending the cash they make. 

- Would a venture capitalist invest in this model? Absolutely not! 
- Would normal investors buy condos for investment when so many are empty? 
- What if the jobs don’t flow fast enough to keep pace with the influx of people? That’s a one-way ticket to civil unrest. 
- And let’s not even talk about the fact that most of these people have no skills to even get a job in the first place. 
- Still, none of these realities has stopped the Chinese government.

In the meantime, there is a bigger crisis ahead as the global economy continues to slow, despite desperate and continuous stimulus policies. **It’s third only to the unprecedented debt and financial assets bubble and China’s debt and infrastructure bubble . . .**

### China's Unprecedented Real Estate Bubble

There has never been a bubble this large in any major country in modern history. Why? Because it’s being driven by unprecedented overinvestment by the unaccountable Chinese government and the very high savings rates by the Chinese populace, especially the more affluent. They love real estate and shun stocks and bonds.

> **They get an A+ for savings, but an F− for asset allocation. This will kill them in the great deflation ahead. **

Take rapidly growing urbanization, growing GDP, growing savings, growing real estate investment, and you get a massive bubble, despite growing vacancies and massive overbuilding. Talk about a paradox! 

And it’s not just real estate. It’s bridges, railways, roads, shopping centers, office buildings, and industrial capacity. Professor Larry Lang at the University of Hong Kong estimates that China has excess capacity of 

- 50% in electrolytic capacitors, 
- 40% in solar batteries, 
- 35% in steel, 
- 30% in flat-screens, and 
- 17% in copper. 
- Aluminum overcapacity is considered to be the greatest, likely at 50%-plus. 

The extremes in Spain and China reflect very high home ownership, high foreign investment, and strong commercial and residential expansion. 

The only way this will continue is with the help of the top 1% to 10% of affluent buyers in these Chinese cities and, to a larger extent, by their foreign buying in key cities globally. 

>  But **foreign buyers are the kiss of death to a fragile economy** because they don’t actually live in the local market and they pull out their money as soon as the party is over. 

Any way you look at it, real estate prices in China are more overvalued than anywhere else in the world. 

>  While developed countries are printing money, China’s printing condos! 

The scary part is that they’re not done. They’re doubling down on their steroid urbanization policy and have committed to moving another 250 million people from rural to urban areas between now and 2025. That’s crazy! 

The biggest problem is that China’s demographic trends have peaked, so now it will be the first emerging country to feel the effects of an aging populace and a declining workforce. It has already slowed since 2011 and will slow much faster from 2025 forward. 

And China’s top-down communist government has no accountability. It’s been pushing urbanization at the fastest and most intensive growth rates in history. 

The U.S. was an emerging country in the 1800s and early 1900s, but even then we only grew at real GDP rates of 5% to 6% compared to 8% to 12% in China during the last few decades. In fact, there are many parallels between the rise of the U.S. from the early 1900s forward to China in the last few decades. But there are also some stark differences. 

#### China: The U.S. of the 21st Century

Fueled by the falling prices and interest rates of a debt bubble, as well as the emergence of powerful new technologies (e.g., cars, electricity, phones, and radios), the U.S. accelerated faster than ever during the Roaring ’20s, even though European industrial and agricultural capacity came back on line to compete. So, we all over-expanded with rising low-cost debt in the Roaring ’20s. This was the epitome of the economic fall season bubble boom in the last long-term economic cycle, similar to the one we saw from 1983 to 2007. 

> But such fall season bubbles always end up having to endure a brutal economic winter season of deflation and deleveraging of the excesses of debt, overexpansion, and cronyism. This is a very good thing in the long-term, but it’s painful in the short-term. 

China has been the largest and fastest-growing emerging country since 1980. It’s now the largest manufacturer and exporter in the world, given its huge trade surpluses. It’s also the second largest economy in the world, albeit with 4.4 times the U.S. population. But its purchasing power (GDP per capita) is only about 20% of the U.S.’s and its actual U.S. dollar GDP per capita is only $5,000, barely 10% of the U.S.’s. **That’s why its overall GDP is just over half of ours.**

> **And it has the greatest bubbles today in GDP growth, stocks, and real estate.** 

In fact, 

- China has significantly more debt than the U.S. did at its 1929 bubble peak and its GDP-per-capita rate is not advancing enough to suggest it will become a developed country like the U.S. did from the 1920s into the 1960s. 
- Besides, it still doesn’t have a democratic government or a free-market system necessary to achieve such developed-country status. 
- Most important, the U.S. had the strong tailwinds of heavy immigration and the baby boom driving it for decades. China has virtually no immigration and its birthrates have been falling for 50 years. 

#### How Soon and How Much?

The Chinese real estate bubble has gotten so extreme that even the government tried to cool it off by requiring very high down payments on second homes and implementing a new capital gains tax of 20%, among other things. So, rich people began to flee. They see the bubble, so they’re getting out of Dodge as fast as they can. 

The Chinese central government wants to grow rapidly. It funnels money to local communist governments to achieve this goal. It also stands behind local government and corporate debt so they can borrow much more and at lower costs to fund infrastructure projects in their respective areas. Those local governments naturally have a group of crony businesses and developers that they favor. 

The Chinese government also holds down interest rates paid on bank and savings deposits to support the banks and encourage lending and building. But this has caused a shadow banking system to grow on the private side, much like the one that helped create the subprime lending crisis in the U.S. Wealth management firms take money from investors and put it into funds that lend against real estate and infrastructure projects at higher yields than investors can get in banks. 

Since 2007, traditional bank lending in China declined as a percent of GDP and has barely grown since 2012. But since that time, shadow bank lending has skyrocketed, advancing to 60% of GDP in just two years. Total bank and shadow bank lending is at 180% of GDP and rising rapidly. This is extremely high for an emerging country. In fact, it’s higher than in most developed countries that have higher incomes and better credit. I estimate China’s total debt at a minimum of 295% of GDP and rising. This compares to 

- Brazil, which has a debt-to-GDP ratio of 152%, 
- India at 130%, and 
- Russia at 78%. 

> Emerging-country households, companies, and financial institutions are not as credit worthy as developed countries, so any total debt ratios above 150% should be considered extremely dangerous. 

> Home ownership is also an extremely important part of Chinese culture. In most cases, a man in China has no chance of getting a date or getting married if he doesn’t own at least a condo or apartment. 

So if the economy collapses, the rich will lose massive amounts of wealth and assets, but the bottom half will be destitute! 

> The bottom 25% of income earners have loan-to-income ratios of 32.4 times. That is off the charts. 

#### The Achilles' Heel of the China Miracle

Today, 760 million people—56% of the Chinese population—live in cities. Of those people, only 69% are registered urban residents. That leaves 247 million, or 31% of the urban population, as unregistered urban residents with no access to education, healthcare, and/or any other social benefits. They are basically “illegal migrants,” and just like the “illegal immigrants” in the U.S., they will only stay as long as opportunities exist and an economic boom tolerates them. 

But what happens when the boom turns to bust? Just as many of our illegal immigrants are returning to Mexico as fast as, if not faster than, new immigrants are entering, the Chinese illegal migrants are already starting to pick up sticks and head back to their family farms, if they haven’t been paved over by crony developers. 

The number of migrant workers dropped 5.68 million to 247 million in 2015. This follows growth rates falling 2 million a year since an annual peak of 12 million in 2010. So it’s gone from 12-million-a-year growth to a decline of nearly 6 million in just five years . . . 

> This brings us back to a crucial question: **who is going to buy all of those empty condos** or use all of the excess infrastructure and industrial capacity the Chinese government is so hell-bent on building when urban migration, the very engine of Chinese growth, has come to a halt and is even reversing? 

I have warned for many years that the greatest disaster in the world is these 247 million unregistered citizens trapped in cities when the overbuilding and work disappear. What are these people going to do? They can’t all go back to their farms as many are paved over with empty condos! 

#### There's One More Thing

> When China’s real estate bubble bursts—and again, it will burst—wealth will evaporate faster than rain in the sun. 

And when its unprecedented real estate bubble bursts, the wealth of its citizens will evaporate as will their worldwide buying spree, just as occurred for the Japanese in the early 1990s forward. **This will send a tsunami of real estate declines around the world.** 

While the Red Dragon’s rapid urbanization has created an unimaginably ugly and dangerous monster of a bubble, it has taken many people out of poverty and raised the average standard of living from $2,000 per capita decades ago to $12,000 per capita (adjusted for purchasing power). Many people in China’s cities today have incomes between $5,000 and $20,000. 

My concern is that China is pushing this urbanization model at such a rapid rate that it will inevitably backfire. They are creating a massive underclass (247 million and now declining), while fostering a completely unaccountable upper class of party politicians and crony businessmen. 

This is a disaster waiting to happen . . . and by the time China works off its incredible excesses at all levels, their demographic trends will become more like Japan’s from 2025 forward.
