## Introduction

Given the proclivity of Mr. Market to *plead temporary insanity* at the drop of a hat, we strongly believe that it’s not worth devoting any time to predicting its actions. We’re not alone in this. After talking to literally thousands of money managers over the past 15 years or so, we’ve discovered that none of *the truly exceptional managers* spend any time at all thinking about what the market will do in the short term. Instead, they all focus on finding *undervalued* stocks that can be held for *an extended time*.

> Company fundamentals have a direct effect on share prices. 
> This principle applies only over a long time period.

## The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing

Here are the five rules that we recommend:

- Do your homework.
- Find economic moats.
- Have a margin of safety.
- Hold for the long haul.
- Know when to sell.

The key to identifying wide economic moats can be found in the answer to a deceptively simple question: How does a company manage to keep competitors at bay and earn consistently fat profits?

Investing should be a long-term commitment because short-term trading means that you’re playing a loser’s game.

## Seven Mistakes to Avoid

Investing is pretty similar. Unless you know how to avoid the most common mistakes of investing, your portfolio’s returns won’t be anything to get excited about. You’ll find that it takes many great stock picks to make up for just a few big errors.

> The reality is that great products do not necessarily translate into great profits.

When you look at a stock, ask yourself, “Is this an attractive business? Would I buy the whole company if I could?” If the answer is no, give the stock a pass—no matter how much you might like the firm’s products.

After looking at which fund categories attracted the most money and which categories experienced the strongest outflows, we found something very interesting. The asset classes that everyone hated outperformed the ones that everyone loved in all but one rolling three-year period over the past dozen years.

Going against the grain takes courage, but that courage pays off. You’ll do better as an investor if you think for yourself and seek out bargains in parts of the market that everyone else has forsaken, rather than buying the flavor of the month in the financial press.

At the end of the day, cash flow is what matters, not earnings. For a host of reasons, accounting-based earnings per share can be made to say just about whatever a company’s management wants them to, but cash flow is much harder to fiddle with.

> If operating cash flows stagnate or shrink even as earnings grow, it’s likely that something is rotten.

## Economic Moats

INVESTORS OFTEN JUDGE companies by looking at which ones have increased profits the most and assuming the trend will persist in the future. But more often than not, the firms that look great in the rearview mirror wind up performing poorly in the future, simply because success attracts competition as surely as night follows day. And the bigger the profits, the stronger the competition. That’s the basic nature of any (reasonably) free market—capital always seeks the areas of highest expected return. Therefore, most highly profitable firms tend to become less profitable over time as competitors chip away at their franchises.

### Evaluating Profitability

For now, just go to a firm’s statement of cash flows, which you can find in its quarterly and annual financial filings, look for the line item labeled “cash flow from operations,” and subtract the line labeled “capital expenditures.”) Firms that generate free cash flow essentially have money left over after reinvesting whatever they need to keep their businesses humming along. In a sense, free cash flow is money that could be extracted from the firm every year without damaging the core business.

Next, divide free cash flow by sales (or revenues), which tells you what proportion of each dollar in revenue the firm is able to convert into excess profits. **If a firm’s free cash flow as a percentage of sales is around 5 percent or better, you’ve found a cash machine—as of mid-2003, only one-half of the S&P 500 pass this test.** Strong free cash flow is an excellent sign that a firm has an economic moat.

Net margin is simply net income as a percentage of sales, and it tells you how much profit the firm generates per dollar of sales. (You can find sales and net income on a firm’s income statement, which should also be in each of its regular financial filings.) In general, firms that can post net margins above 15 percent are doing something right.


When you’re looking at all four of these metrics, look at more than just one year. A firm that has consistently cranked out solid ROEs, good free cash flow, and decent margins over a number of years is much more likely to truly have an economic moat than a firm with more erratic results. Consistency is important when evaluating companies, because it’s the ability to keep competitors at bay for an extended period of time—not just for a year or two—that really makes a firm valuable. Five years is the absolute minimum time period for evaluation, and I’d strongly encourage you to go back 10 years if you can.

### Building an Economic Moat

> When you’re examining the sources of a firm’s economic moat, the key thing is to never stop asking, “Why?” Why aren’t competitors stealing the firm’s customers? Why can’t a competitor charge a lower price for a similar product or service? Why do customers accept annual price increases?

#### Real Product Differentiation

Unfortunately, simply having better technology or more features is usually not a sustainable strategy because there are always competitors hoping to build a better mouse-trap. And because having the best product or service usually means charging a premium price, firms pursuing this strategy often limit the size of their potential market. Many customers will be satisfied with a slightly inferior product at a significantly lower price.

Finally, constant innovation generally sucks up a large amount of capital in the form of research and development expenses, which can make a product-differentiation strategy very expensive.

The lesson here is that although firms can occasionally generate enormous excess profits—and enormous stock returns—by staying one step ahead of the technological curve, these profits are usually short-lived. Unless you are familiar enough with the inner workings of an industry to know when a firm’s products are being supplanted by better ones, **be wary of firms that rely solely on innovation to sustain their competitive advantage**.

#### Perceived Product Differentiation

Very often, however, a firm with consistently better products or services creates a brand for itself, and a strong brand can constitute a very wide economic moat. The wonderful thing about a brand is that as long as customers perceive your product or service as better than everyone else’s, it makes relatively little difference whether it actually is different.

When you’re evaluating whether a strong brand really does create an economic moat, it’s not enough to look at whether consumers trust the product or have an emotional connection to the brand. The brand has to justify the cost of creating it by actually making money for the firm, and sustaining a powerful brand usually requires a lot of expensive advertising. Therefore, unless the brand actually increases consumers’ willingness to pay and those looser wallets translate into consistently positive returns on capital, the brand may not be worth as much as you’d thought.

#### Driving Costs Down

Airlines and PCs are known as commodity industries, in which products are tough to differentiate. Low-cost strategies work especially well in these types of markets. Even in noncommodity markets, lower costs can bring large advantages as long as the cost advantage is sustainable and not temporary. However, it’s not enough to just look at a firm’s profit margins and say that such-and-such firm has lower costs than its competitors—you need to identify the sources of those cost savings, which can come in a variety of flavors.

#### Locking In Customers

If you can make it difficult—in terms of either money or time—for a customer to switch to a competing product, you can charge your customers more and make more money—simple in theory, but difficult in practice.

#### Locking Out Competition

By the time competitors such as Yahoo! and Amazon.com tried to get into the auction game, it was too late. There were already too many bidders on eBay for sellers to want to switch to a new, smaller auction service—they’d probably get a lower price for their wares because there were fewer bidders on each item. Meanwhile, the bidders weren’t interested in going anywhere either because eBay had by far the most items for sale. Thus, eBay gained critical mass and, today, a near-monopoly position in the online-auction market. Another great example is money-transfer concern Western Union, which is owned by First Data. With more than 70,000 locations worldwide, odds are pretty good that Western Union can get your money wherever you need it to go, and the value of the firm’s agent network only grows larger as it adds locations. The central characteristic of a classic network effect is a virtuous circle—more users attract more users.

## The Language of Investing

Right now, you’re probably wondering why we need an income statement and a cash flow statement—after all, if a company makes money, it makes money, right? The difference lies in a confusing concept called accrual accounting. Here’s how it works. Companies record sales (or revenue) when a service or a good is provided to the buyer, regardless of when the buyer pays. As long as the company is reasonably certain that the buyer will eventually pay the bill, the company can post the sale to its income statement. The cash flow statement, on the other hand, is concerned only with when cash is received and when it goes out the door. I’ll go over the cash flow statement in detail later in this chapter, but here’s a quick example.

The key takeaway here is that the income statement and cash flow statement can tell different stories about a business because they’re constructed using different sets of rules. The income statement strives to match revenues and expenses as closely as possible—that’s why we had to deduct the $1 in depreciation from Mike’s profits, and that’s why Mike gets to record the $7 in sales that he made on credit. But the cash flow statement cares only about the dollar bills that go in and out the door, regardless of the timing of the actions that generated those dollar bills.

> This simple concept—the difference between accounting profits and cash profits—is the key to understanding almost everything there is to know about how a business works, as well as how to separate great businesses from poor ones.

## Financial Statements Explained

Retained earnings is a cumulative account; therefore, each year that the company makes a profit and doesn’t pay it all out as dividends, retained earnings increase. Likewise, if a company has lost money over time, retained earnings can turn negative and is often renamed “accumulated deficit” on the balance sheet. Think of this account as a company’s long-term track record at generating profits.

Firms that grant their employees a ton of options and then spend corporate cash on repurchases are essentially selling shares to their employees at low prices and buying it back on the open market at much higher prices, which is not the best use of capital.

## Analyzing a Company - The Basics

Paying less taxes and buying back shares are good things for shareholders, no question, but they’re short-term fixes rather than long-term sources of earnings growth.

In general, any nonfinancial firm that can generate consistent ROEs above 10 percent without excessive leverage is at least worth investigatin. **And if you can find a company with the potential for consistent ROEs over 20 percent, there’s a good chance you’re really on to something.**

I think it’s reasonable to say that any firm that’s able to **convert more than 5 percent of sales to free cash flow**—just divide free cash flow by sales to get this percentage—is doing a solid job at generating excess cash.

## Analyzing a Company - Management

First, look at the raw level of cash compensation to see if it’s reasonable. There’s not necessarily a strict limit here, though I personally think an $8 million cash bonus is silly no matter how well the company has done. (For reference, the average CEO of a large U.S. firm currently earns about 500 times as much as the average employee. Twenty years ago, this multiple was just 40.)

Rewarding management for consummating an acquisition is an absolutely terrible idea—paying big bonuses just for getting a deal done simply encourages executives to go out and do more dubious deals. A better idea, though not one I’ve ever seen implemented, would be to wait a couple of years and pay a bonus only if an acquisition has provided an adequate—and predetermined—return on the investment.



## Avoiding Financial Fakery

### Six Red Flags

#### Declining Cash Flow

Even if accounting gobbledygook makes your head spin, there is one very simple thing you can do: Watch cash flow. Over time, increases in a company’s cash flow from operations should roughly track increases in net income. If you see cash from operations decline even as net income keeps marching upward—or if cash from operations increases much more slowly than net income—watch out. This usually means that the company is generating sales without necessarily collecting the cash, and that’s a very good recipe for a blowup down the road.

- Lucent was extending credit to anyone who could spell photon, which meant it was booking many sales without receiving the cash. (Think back to our hot dog stand example in Chapter 4—as long as a firm ships a product and has reasonable certainty that it will eventually collect the cash, it can post the sale.)
- Lucent kept building more gear than it could ship, which sent inventories upward.
- Lucent’s pension plan was pumping up net income with noncash gains.
